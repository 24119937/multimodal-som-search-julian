Cross-Cultural Psychology is a leading textbook offering senior
undergraduate and graduate students a thorough and balanced
overview of the whole field of cross-cultural psychology. The team of
internationally acclaimed authors present the latest empirical research,
theory, methodology and applications from around the world. They
discuss all domains of behavior (including development, social behavior,
personality, cognition, psycholinguistics, emotion and perception), and
present the three main approaches in cross-cultural psychology
(cultural, culture-comparative, and indigenous traditions) as well as
applications to a number of domains (including acculturation,
intercultural relations and communication, work and health). With new
additions to the writing team, the third edition benefits from an even
broader range of cross-cultural perspectives. Now in 2-colour, the
format is even more reader-friendly and the features include chapter
outlines, chapter summaries, further reading and an updated glossary of key terms. This edition
also offers an accompanying website containing additional material and weblinks.
