Designer-approved tips

Exclusive
The Ideal Home and Garden March 2015  |  19 
Over the past few months, I have been receiving numerous emails, all with 
the request of putting together a Home Special. We took our time putting 
one out, simply because there was just so much material to pore over, trends 
to scour through and experts to talk to, before we were convinced of being 
able to put forward a thorough guide for you. And here it is. Our designer-
approved Home Special issue.
If acquiring a home has been challenging enough, setting it up is likely to be a bigger one. Th e options out there are 
plenty, and you are somewhat spoilt for choice. Should I follow a theme, a colour scheme perhaps? Where should 
I pick my furniture from? Do I need to hire an interior designer, may be just some of the questions clouding your 
mind. Add to that, free fl owing advice and you are confused about where to start.
Th at‚Äôs where we are stepping in. We have picked fi ve of the most popular expert-backed living trends for you, that 
are guaranteed to help you set up your space in style. Whatever the style, we have the inspiration for you right here. 
And no, it is not just family homes we have addressed. For all you young professionals looking at setting up your 
own pad in the city, we have something for you too. All you need is to take a look at our Single in the City feature, 
for inspiration.
Th e regular sections are, of course, packed with oodles of information as usual. From extensive shopping guides, 
ideal getaway ideas, kitchen and garden trends to what to spend your money on, here‚Äôs all the dope. 
Happy reading and here‚Äôs wishing everyone a very Happy Holi!

√Å Th e recently-opened In Joy store in 
the capital‚Äôs Meherchand Market fi lled 
with colourful artefacts, has struck a 
chord with me. Th e Spring-Summer 
2015 collection at the store, which is 
Nisha Sahai‚Äôs brainchild,  is a homage 
to the decade of the bohemian ‚Äô70s.
√Å Delhi-based designer Poonam Kalra‚Äôs designs in wood are

SANTA‚ÄôS VALENTINE
My fi rst thought aft er seeing the 
latest issue of TIHG was a big 
wow! It diff used my stress, which 
I was undergoing in deciding gift s 
for my loved ones for Valentine‚Äôs 
Day. Th e regular feature ‚ÄòShopping 
Spree‚Äô had something for every 
age group, class, and taste. Th e 
products showcased in the 
cushions, rugs, coasters and mugs 
features‚Äîall looked worth gift ing 
to somebody around me. And one 
story that totally engrossed me 
was ‚ÄòWith Love‚Äô as it was dedicated 
to Valentine‚Äôs Day. I am sure this 
Valentine‚Äôs Day is going to win me 
many more new friends.

BOLD AND BEAUTIFUL 
The best part about the magazine is that 
it turns every event into a celebration. 
In the Feb issue, regular features ‚ÄòGrey 
Matters‚Äô, ‚ÄòLimited Edition‚Äô, ‚ÄòGlam Effect‚Äô, 
and specially ‚ÄòColours and Crafts‚Äô 
maintained 
the magazine‚Äôs 
class. It 
assured 
that 2015 is 
going to be 
as beautiful, 
innovative, 
and eventful 
as previous 
years. But 
the best 
stories were 
for young valentines. The gifting ideas 
through ‚ÄòGraphic Alert‚Äô, ‚ÄòMug It Up‚Äô, 
‚ÄòFrame Worthy‚Äô, ‚ÄòWith Love‚Äô, ‚ÄòCrystal 
Elegance‚Äô were simply mind blowing. 
TIHG is the biggest love guru this 
Valentine. 
Padma Jagdish, New Delhi
STARTING WELL 
Every month TIHG takes me back to 
golden days of my childhood. Aft er 
many years of leaving school, 
I relive the experience by preparing 
a scrapbook. Articles and features 
like ‚ÄòColours and Craft s‚Äô, ‚ÄòAll Th ings 
Quirky‚Äô, and ‚ÄòShopping Spree‚Äô add 
beauty to my house. But the question 
remains of who awards those brownie 
points, which my teacher used to 
give. It is none other than guests and 
visitors who are awestruck by seeing 
the beautiful and exotic elements in 
my sweet home. Th ank you for keeping 
the child in me alive.

CORRIGENDUM
In the February 2015 issue of The Ideal Home 
and Garden, Shopping Spree Roll-out Comfort 
on page 39, the prices and the respective 
brand names were missing. Following are the 
correct descriptions:
   1. Psychedelic Collection, starts from 
       `40,000, Qaaleen
   2. Restro & street art rug, starts from 
       `50,000, Cocoon Fine Rug

   4. Hand tufted rug, price on request, IDUS
   5. Ombre Rug, price on request, Surprise 
       Home Linen. 
Also, the MD of brand Nur in the story Crafts & 
Colours was wrongly credited as Raman Bahl. 
The correct name is Aman Bahl. 
The inadvertent errors are regretted. - Editor

Top tips for a 
quirky home
y

Your quirky home 
should feature at least 
one element in an 
unconventional way.
y
Go for bold and bright 
coloured stripes that 
give an eye-popping 
effect to the home.
y 
 When doing up your 
quirky space, spend 
more time in sourcing 
for artworks from local 
artists or those that 
use unusual media to 
showcase their work.
y
The most fun part in 
doing a quirky space is 
mixing and matching 
decor styles. Keep to two 
or three decor schemes 
for a classy feel.
Th e oversized collage of family photos 
in this home by H5 Design is a good 
example of an unconventional feature.

individuals are quite secure and 
confident in their choice of living 
well now-a-days. With change in a 
single individual‚Äôs lifestyle, the home 
too tends to mirror the homeowner‚Äôs 
personal style. Shabnam Gupta, 
Principal Designer, The Orange Lane, 
has created stylish spaces for single 
people, both male and female. She 
concurs, ‚ÄúTypically, bachelor homes 
would be more experimental in their 
material; for example, concrete floorings 
and strong use of colours in the entire 
space, not conventional furniture.‚Äù 
 
Dulux‚Äôs new colour trends for the new 
year also acknowledges the showcase of  
masculine and feminine characteristics 
in the home space. The ‚ÄúHim+Her‚Äù 
style can be applied and used for 
decoration in different types of rooms 
such as the bedroom, workspace, living 
room or kitchen.  Dulux recommends 
painting dark blue and slate grey on the 
walls with decorations in black leather 
chairs and dark furniture as perfect 
living for men.

Designer Speak
How did you discover that dead 
things can be brought back to life?
I saw people throwing things as 
junk and garbage. I realised these 
products have too much potential 
in terms of material strength. It‚Äôs 
just that people are not aware of 
the right usage or putting them 
back to a right shape. Th is is where 
I stepped in. I got my hands on a 
few interesting tools to make pieces 
of art. Th ese products included 
bottles, wooden planks, pots, stools, 
etc. And, the end result is amazing.
How would you describe your 
style?
My style is to create something 
new around a product that has 
already had an existence. Th e 
initial stage of product making has 
many challenges but it is also right 
to say that the end result is fun.
Talk more about the challenges 
you face in bringing out creations 
under Jugaad Factory...
We invest a lot of our time in 
research and development. We are 
in the process of launching a range 
of new products for our buyers 
this year. We are also working on 
new strategies for the brand that 
will include marketing activities 
to increase visibility amongst the 
right customers. Th e journey so 
far has been fruitful. What we are 
churning 
out of 
Jugaad 
Factory is 
unique in 
the market 
and we don‚Äôt 
have any 
competitors 
as such.
Jugaad Factory is a place 
where an unusual combination 
of materials are used to 
create innovative products. 
Handcrafted, handpainted, 
printed or personalized as 
required, it also undertakes

Designer Speak
What would you describe as being 
key to your success?
Each project comes to us with 
a challenge. But aft er achieving 
the required design, texture and 
colour, and getting the product to 
reach the stage where I can 
call it a divine piece of art is what 
we look forward to. Th is requires a 
lot of research and hard work. And, 
I feel success comes along with 
hard work.
Tell us more about the new 
product range from Jugaad 
Factory. Any plans to cater to new 
segments?
We‚Äôve come out with quirky 
posters, kitchen prayers, colourful 
lamps, painted pots, shoes, T-shirts 
and much more. For upcoming 
product range, we would like to 
keep it covered for few months. 
But, just to give you an idea, the 
brand will be launching technical 
products for home use. Apart 
from selling our products on 
known e-portals, we also plan to 
launch our own online portal for 
convenient shopping experience.
Where do you get your inspiration 
from?
I take inspiration from nature, 
friends, family ‚Äî actually 
everything. It‚Äôs funny but I also 
take inspiration from little things 
in life, while shopping, talking to a 
friend, staring at an object.
What materials do you enjoy 
working with the most?
All materials are easy to work 
with ‚Äî be it metal, wood, iron, 
fabric, ceramic, glass or any 
other. Everything is manmade 
and you just 
learn by burning fi ngers.
According to you, is design 
an art or a science?
Design is a mix of art and 
science. Because you can‚Äôt 
create a divine piece without 
the use of some kind of 
technology. So, both art and 
science go hand-in-hand. 
What advice do you have for 
young and upcoming designers?
Believe in yourself and believe 
in the design. Join places where 
you can grow your talent because 
everything will not be in the 
books. It is always better to have 
a fi rsthand experience and a right 
teacher.

J
enny Bhatt, an established 
artist who has been exhibiting 
her work since the mid‚Äînineties, 
has evolved over time. Th is is, in 
part, owing to her experimental 
style and the exposure to the 
creative possiblilties off ered by 
technology when working at 
a digital design studio. Now, 
she is engaged in solo and 
group exhibitions along with 
publishing pieces on art. Across 
her chosen media, the colours 
come across as vibrant and the 
strokes as free. Positivity exudes 
from her works. Most are about 
colour and through colour, the 
exploration of the self. As far 
as infl uences go, she borrows 
images from diff erent sources like 
Vedantic Th eory and Pop Art. 
Th e award‚Äîwinning artist has 
never viewed art and design as 
being hierarchical or completely 
separable. Her style can be 
classifi ed as pop surrealist or 
neo‚Äîpop. Over time, humour 
has also become an integral 
part of her individual voice, and 
now she has started exploring 
it in various forms‚Äîpainting, 
writing, digital interactive pieces, 
sculptural objects, design and 
most recently, stand up comedy. 
‚ÄúMy work is concerned with the 
urban mind, especially, the 
urban Indian feminine identity,‚Äù 
says Jenny, who believes in a 
‚Äòwhole brain approach‚Äô‚Äîrather 
than an intuitive one to art, 
which she defi nes as ‚ÄúCreative as 
well as pragmatic‚Äù.

The Ibiza kitchen has an organic shape and 
smooth curves. The best part about this design 
is that it comes with no sharp corners. ‚ÄúYour 
dream of owning a private island comes true 
with the Ibiza kitchen. The shutters are high 
gloss lacquered and comes in array of colours,‚Äù 
says Kirit Joshi, Director, Spacewood.
Special Feature
The Ideal Home and Garden March 2015  |  103 
Planned elegantly 
with the right kind of 
drawers and a full range 
of built-in appliances, 
the kitchen gives a 
truly compact yet 
fully functional look. 
The use of high-gloss 
membrane shutters with 
handles in steel finish 
is perfect for a modern 
look. The worktop is 
all-white corian which 
ends beautifully as a 
breakfast bar. ‚ÄúThe 
kitchen really sums 
up to an ideal one. 
From small to big 
appliances, this kitchen 
accomodates everything 
for a perfect cooking 
session,‚Äù shares Kirit.
Ozo uses a combination 
of high-gloss white 
polymer shutters and 
aluminum-framed 
shutters in stunning 
red black painted glass. 
With handle-less units, 
the cabinets give a sleek 
look. ‚ÄúThe extended 
dining area can be 
used as a preparation 
counter which snugly 
fits into the kitchen. 
The units have ample 
space for storage along 
with neatly planned 
provision for built-in 
appliances,‚Äù shares Kirit.

A huge kitchen designed 
using a combination of 
drawers and tall units with 
a big island, this ultra-
modern looking kitchen 
uses Blum Intivo fittings 
enabling them to carry 
loads upto 50 kilos each. 
The worktop uses corian 
to achieve 100 mm thick 
look. ‚ÄúThe island serves  
the dual function of 
cleaning and serving, 
thus making cooking a 
complete experience,‚Äù 
suggests Kirit.

‚ÄúThe kitchen creates a 
great fusion of wood 
and glossy elements. 
Using dark walnut 
finish in engineered 
wood shutters and open 
units in high gloss ivory 
acrylic ply, it‚Äôs perfect 
for informal dining,‚Äù 
suggests Kirit. Specially 
designed floating base 
units can bear up to 300 
kilos and the cabinets 
come in a simple yet 
sleek look. The highlight 
of the kitchen is the 
super-sized dining-cum-
wash area, of course, the 
unique unit with roll-up 
shutters in glass.
The back painted glass 
gives this kitchen a 
distinct character. 
With the hot selling 
combination, this kitchen 
is designed using silver 
foiled shutters in a ribbed 
look along with wenge 
shutters. A space divider 
separates the kitchen 
work counter and a higher 
serving counter makes it 
an ideal bar counter.

lthough a traditional home 
feature, a coutyard is a still  
sought-after by the discerning 
homeowner. It allows making use of   
the outdoors in privacy while having 
other multiple uses. For the Chawlas, 
the coutyard is a symbol of luxury.
‚ÄúThe idea was to create a space that 
was not just functional but also 
emanated an awe-inspiring feel. The

a 40 ft. high courtyard with a life-

with huge walk-in closets and plenty of 
natural lighting. Th e bathroom features 
products from Gessi and Villeroy and 
Boch, and the kitchen is fi tted with 
Bertazoni designs.
Th e landscaping of the home began 
at the time when the construction on 
the plot was undertaken. As a result, 
‚ÄúGulmohars, jacarandas, camellias 
and laburnums surround the plot and 
provide an unreal view from any corner 
inside the house. A large water body 
situated near the entrance adds to the 
calming eff ect. Th e front lawn features a 
large sculpture that instantly raises the 
glam quotient,‚Äù tells Monica.
Th e innate sensibilities of the owners lean 
towards contemporary style and this is 
refl ected in their home. Th is stark look 
is complemented by indigenous touches 
through jaalis and motifs in traditional 
patterns seen across the rooms.

Flavours
of INDIA
W
ith an aim to redefi ne the 
Indian dhaba around the 
corner, we spent two to three 
months scanning the Delhi-NCR 
market and realised that despite 
Indian food being so popular, 
it is surprisingly diffi  cult to get 
good quality Indian food at 
moderate prices,‚Äù shares 
Megha Tuli, Founder and CEO, 
Leaping Caravan. 
Located at the heart of DLF 
Phase 4, Gurgaon, Leaping 
Caravan is a home delivery brand 
that serves Indian food from the 
Grand Trunk Road. Operating 
out of a 3,000 sq ft  commercial 
grade kitchen, Leaping Caravan 
takes inspiration from old 
world charm to food that is 
fast fading‚Äîheritage recipes, 
joy from vintage and age-old 
Indian food. ‚ÄúMy idea was to 
refresh Indian food and bring 
in a diff erent style of cooking 
that is not dominated by cream, 
butter and garam masala. Most 
of our recipes are heritage recipes 
that have been handed down by 
families that have lived on the 
Grand Trunk Road. Th e recipes 
are followed closely and the food 
made exactly the way it was made 
back then,‚Äù shares Megha. 
With food from six vibrant 
locations‚ÄîBengal, Uttar 
Pradesh, Delhi, Punjab, Pakistan 
and Afghanistan, Leaping 
Caravan off ers a delightfully 
traditional experience.

F
resh and Local is an initiative to transform 
underutilised urban area into community 
places that grow food. The team includes Nicola 
Antaki, an RIBA certified architect; anthropology 
graduate Aditi Punj; Adrienne Thadani, founder 
of Fresh and Local, and a double Unltd India 
Investee, and Ganesh Lokare, who has a farming 
background and has worked as a junior program 
associate for Aangan. Here, they share choicest 
insights on urban farming and a few picks from 
their numerous, green projects.
 
The process of creating a  
garden can most be divided  
into three parts 
THINK THROUGH 
y
Assess and reflect on the 
space‚ÄîHow much sunlight 
does it get? Where is there 
most sunlight? Where is the 
water source? Where is the 
drain and in which direction 
does the water flow?
y   Assess and reflect on what you 
want to grow‚ÄîVegetables, 
Fruit trees? Herbs? Flowers? 
What time of year do these 
grow or bloom?
y
What is my budget? How 
should my garden look, natural 
and wild, or well-put together?  
y
Typically, we visit a site, 
assess the water source, 
sunlight and learn what 
the client wants along with 
their budget.  
This helps us move on to 
research and design.
Step 1: 
Green House
136  |  March 2015  The Ideal Home and Garden
RESEARCH 
y 
Visit garden shops and 
nurseries in or around your 
locality so you know where 
to source basics like soil, 
cow manure, coco soil, 
plants
y 
 Check out container 
options. There are 
multiple‚Äîranging from 
high-end and beautiful to 
thrifty and simple (plastic 
crates or other secondhand 
materials).  Every material 
has its pros and cons‚Äî 
clay dries quickly, bamboo 
decomposes with time, 
metal heats up and plastic 
degrades in the sun.
Step 2: 
EACH SPACE IS UNIQUE AND CALLS FOR  
INNOVATIVE IDEAS AND DESIGNS: 
y
Elevate your containers especially for the monsoon as it 
allows for free flow of water.
y
Instead of lining your containers with pieces of clay from 
old pots, use old cloth or rags. This does not block the water 
flow and allows for proper filtered drainage.
y
Use coco soil and dry leaves to aerate your soil.
Step 3:

Event 
T
his year‚Äôs India Art Fair in 
Delhi featured a significant 
new element in the appointment 
of Girish Shahane as the artistic 
director. Overseeing both the 
Art ATTACK
Artistic Projects and the 
Speakers‚Äô Forum, Shahane 
integrated a closely curated 
artistic programme with the 
fair. This brought a focus to 
the talks and projects to make 
them directly relevant to the 
galleries and artists exhibiting 
onsite and more accessible for 
visitors within the context of 
the fair.
Presenting partner YES 
Bank hosted a series of 
talks and events in the YES 
Bank Lounge - including 
conversations with artists and 
collectors; workshops with 
the Asia Art Archive;book 
launches for Arpita Singh 
with Vadehra Art Gallery, 
and Forms of Devotion with 
Sushma Bahl and the Museum 
of Sacred Art.
The seventh edition 
of the India Art Fair 
recently concluded in 
the capital witnessed 
an amalgamation of 
not just art specialists 
but design enthusiasts 
and budding 
collectors alike.

Event 
Another noticeable feature 
of this year‚Äôs event was the 
significant percentage of sales 
made to new buyers. With 
80,000 plus visitors attending, 
sales were recorded on average 
as 25 per cent stronger than 
the 2014 edition ‚Äî with six 
sell-out booths, and figures 
indicating that the top two per 
cent collectors spent over ` 30 
crore collectively.
A majority of the galleries were 
able to report new collectors 
and clientele coming not just 
from the capital but also from 
Ahmedabad, Chandigarh 
and Jaipur. Besides, India Art 
Fair 2015 hosted over 1,100 
artists, of which many were 
from Tier II and Tier III cities. 
The latter not only enjoyed 
the opportunity to exhibit on 
a prestigious international 
platform but enjoyed positive 
sales as well.
There was an interactive 
performance by Le M√©ridien 
and LM 100 member Esther 
Maasdam ‚Äî the global latte 
artist along with visual artist, 
Sohan Jakhar. The event 
was India‚Äôs introduction to 
the newly-launched annual 
Inspiration Brewed Here 
campaign. 
‚ÄúIndia Art Fair acts as a 
catalyst for progress, driving 
deeper understanding of the 
country‚Äôs artistic history as 
well as the latest contemporary 
works from across India, 
stimulating dialogue, debate, 
understanding and interaction 
not only with art specialists, 
but with the wider public 
and collectors of tomorrow,‚Äù 
says Neha Kirpal, Founding 
Director, India Art Fair.
This important element 
of India Art Fair‚Äôs mission 
extends to all ages and the fair 
was pleased to welcome 16 
school groups and thousands 
of students who visited from 
Delhi and around the country 
to learn and engage with art  
in India.
