Abstract
We studied the incidence and correlates of status projection—use of material possessions to emphasize social status to others—
among 100 adolescents in a historical context of rising afﬂuence. Participants listed 10 possessions, rated each for its value as a
status symbol, and chose ﬁve to discuss with another participant in a forthcoming interaction. Participants selected especially those
of their possessions that they had rated higher in status value (p < .001). This effect was stronger among those reporting upward
or downward change in their families’ socioeconomic status (p< .05), greater actual‐ideal self‐discrepancies (p < .05), and stronger
commitment to materialistic values (p < .01); moreover, the effect of changing status was stronger among higher materialists
(p< .05). These results indicate that people self‐complete through presenting their possessions selectively to others, and they help
to clarify the precise role of identity commitment in symbolic self‐completion. Copyright # 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
In late modern society, social class boundaries are increas-
ingly permeable (Giddens, 1991), and social status is often
inferred from material consumption (Dittmar, 2008). Thus,
people have to choose whether or not to compete with their
neighbors in attempting to live up to images of success that are
constantly primed by the media. Some seem to relish in
projecting an elevated image of their socioeconomic status
(SES). Examples are individuals who appear to deﬁne
themselves by the car they drive and proudly leave their
branded car keys on show, or the couple who sends around an
annual circular to friends about this year’s cruise holiday, and
their son’s ever‐increasing salary.
MATERIAL POSSESSIONS AS STATUS SYMBOLS
This paper focuses on the use of material possessions as
symbolic markers of status. Research has shown that certain
material possessions are understood fairly consensually as
markers of particular identity categories, including SES
(Dittmar, 1992), and that people often buy consumer goods
to seek particular identities (Dittmar, 2005a). Yet, merely
owning a possession may not be sufﬁcient to warrant the
identity it symbolizes. Research suggests that most identity
claims only gain validity to the extent that they are recognized
and accepted by others in one’s immediate social context (see
Reicher, 1995; Schlenker, 2003). Hence, material possessions
may function more effectively as identity markers to the extent
that they are seen and recognized as such by others.
According to Goffman (1951), status symbols function to
divide the world into visible social categories. They identify
the social positions of individuals, as well as expressing the
lifestyles, views, and values of different social groups. It is
possible “that symbols may come to be employed in a
‘fraudulent’ way, that is, to signify a status, which the claimant
does not in fact possess” (p. 296). However, social class
boundaries are relatively hard to deﬁne objectively. Hence, “on
the whole […], class symbols serve not so much to represent or
misrepresent one’s position, but rather to inﬂuence in a desired
direction other persons’ judgment of it” (p. 297). According to
Goffman (1959), such self‐presentation processes typically
involve the selective ‘over‐communication’ of some facts and
‘under‐communication’ of other facts (for a review, see
Schlenker, 2003). Adopting this terminology, we use the
phrase status projection to refer to the over‐communication of
SES, through selectively displaying to others those of one’s
material possessions that best serve as status symbols.
SYMBOLIC SELF‐COMPLETION
The symbolic self‐completion theory of Wicklund and
Gollwitzer (1982) suggests a combination of social and
psychological factors likely to be involved in status projection.
They note that people often aim to deﬁne themselves in terms
of particular valued identities. When the route to a desired
identity is blocked, or when identity claims are in some way
insecure, people experience their identities as “incomplete”
and thus will be motivated to “complete themselves” using
available identity markers. Although driven by intrapsychic
concerns, social interaction is understood to play a key role in
the process of symbolic self‐completion: identity claims must

be displayed to, and validated by, others to resolve feelings
of incompleteness. Nevertheless, research has investigated
only indirectly the role of symbolic self‐completion in the
presentation of material possessions to others.
Braun and Wicklund (1989) tested a symbolic self‐
completion theory account of “conspicuous consumption”.
Across ﬁve studies, they found that law students believed they
were more recognizable as lawyers from their external
characteristics than did practicing attorneys; that ﬁrst‐year
students reported owning more articles displaying their
university’s logo than did fourth‐year students; that tennis
beginners with a relatively strong commitment to tennis showed
greater brand orientation than did either expert tennis players or
beginners with a weaker commitment to tennis; that committed
business and economics students who found their studies
relatively difﬁcult perceived their hobbies, sports, and holiday
destinations as more prestigious than did either those who found
their studies easier or those who were less committed; and that
committed business and economics students made to feel
insecure about their study area perceived their holiday destina-
tions as more fashionable for business students than did either
those made to feel secure about their study area or those who
were less committed. Although ﬁndings were weaker in a sixth
study, the overall pattern was consistent: self‐symbolizing was
strongest among those with less secure identity status, especially
if they were more committed to the identities in question.
These studies provide initial support for the use of material
possessions in symbolic self‐completion, but they included
no behavioral measure of the extent to which participants
displayed their identity‐relevant possessions and activities to
others, despite the theoretical importance of self‐presentation
in the self‐completion process (for behavioral outcomes of self‐
completion in other domains, see Harmon‐Jones, Schmeichel,
& Harmon‐Jones, 2009, on academics, and Wicklund &
Gollwitzer, 1982, on German winemakers). Moreover, the
identities examined were restricted to occupational and
sporting memberships. Yet, symbolic self‐completion theory
has an obvious afﬁnity with Goffman’s (1951) theoretical
account of status symbols. One might predict that people
whose SES is insecure in some way, would be especially
motivated to verify their SES through status projection; the
effect would be stronger among those with more commitment
to SES as a valued identity domain.
TWO FORMS OF IDENTITY INCOMPLETENESS
Reﬂecting Braun and Wicklund’s (1989) operational deﬁni-
tion of insecurity in terms of being a “newcomer” to a given
identity, symbolic self‐completion theory predicts that mem-
bers of newly afﬂuent families will engage more actively in
attempts to promote an image of wealth, compared with
members of families that have been wealthy for many
generations. Consistent with this hypothesis, sociologists have
proposed the existence of a nouveau riche class, whose
members are especially invested in using status symbols
owing to their recent—and hence, insecure—rise in SES
(Goffman, 1951; see also Smith, 2003); however, we are
aware of no existing quantitative test of this phenomenon.
Notably, there is no reason to suppose that such effects
necessarily would be restricted to the upwardly mobile. Unlike
the occupational memberships typically studied within
symbolic self‐completion theory, social status carries a more
tangible possibility of downward as well as upward mobility.
Presumably, people experiencing downward mobility will be
at least as insecure about their status as the upwardly mobile.
Hence, one might predict a curvilinear relationship between
SES change and status projection: effects would be strongest
among members of upwardly or downwardly mobile families,
and weakest among members of families with relatively stable
SES.
Braun and Wicklund (1989) argue that symbolic self‐
completion should occur only in response to insecurity in
speciﬁc, relevant identities, suggesting that status projection
should be provoked only by insecure SES, not by insecurity on
other identity dimensions (see also Ledgerwood, Liviatan &
Carnevale, 2007). In contrast, studies into self‐afﬁrmation and
self‐esteem maintenance suggest that individuals often cope
with identity threat in one domain by afﬁrming or enhancing
identity in unrelated domains (Sherman & Cohen, 2006; Tesser,
2000). Gollwitzer and Wicklund (1985, Study 1) showed that
self‐symbolizing as a “female professional” was not provoked
when female students committed to this identity were made
to feel insecure about their potential capabilities as a mother—
an irrelevant identity. However, they had selected participants
with high career orientation and low family orientation; hence,
the lack of response to this threat may simply have reﬂected a
lack of commitment to the potential mothering role—and
hence, no experience of “incompleteness”—rather than the
impossibility of using self‐completion in one domain of
identity to cope with incompleteness in another domain. In
contrast, Dittmar (2005a) found that compulsive buying
tendencies were predicted by a general measure of actual‐
ideal self‐discrepancies. Seemingly, individuals were attempt-
ing to compensate for feelings of incompleteness by acquiring
new material possessions, irrespective of the speciﬁc domains
in which they felt incomplete. Yet, to our knowledge, no
previous study has evaluated effects of both speciﬁc and
general forms of identity incompleteness together.
THE ROLE OF MATERIALISTIC VALUES
Symbolic self‐completion theory emphasizes that self‐
completion strategies occur as an interactive function of identity
incompleteness and commitment to the identity in question. We
reasoned that commitment to SES as a valued dimension of
identity would be greatest among people with strongly
materialistic beliefs and values (Kasser, Ryan, Couchman, &
Sheldon, 2004). Hence, a traditional reading of the theory
predicts an interaction effect of status change and materialistic
values as predictors of status projection: SES change will lead
to “incompleteness” and thus predict status projection only to
the extent that the individual holds materialistic values;
conversely, materialistic values will predict status projection
only to the extent that SES is somehow insecure.
Interaction effects have also been predicted in studies using
general rather than speciﬁc measures of identity incompleteness

(Dittmar, 2005a, 2008). This requires a somewhat different
theoretical rationale from the original conceptualization of
symbolic self‐completion. There is no theoretical reason to
suppose that materialistic values would increase the pressure
for self‐completion arising from unrelated self‐discrepancies.
However, it seems plausible that holding such values might
enhance the appeal of materialistic self‐completion strategies,
such as compulsive buying or status projection, given sufﬁcient
feelings of incompleteness arising from some other domain.
Empirical support for this second form of interaction has
been somewhat elusive (H. E. Dittmar, personal communica-
tion). However, there could be a methodological explanation
for this lack of support. Since materialistic values are closely
associated with various measures of poor psychological
adjustment (e.g., Dittmar, 2005a; Kasser et al., 2004), this
suggests that materialistic values and generalized identity
insecurity may often be somewhat confounded, making it
relatively difﬁcult statistically to detect a positive interaction
between the two factors.
CONTEXT, AIMS AND HYPOTHESES
The conditions described earlier for the emergence of status
projection may be especially prevalent in contemporary, post‐
industrial societies. Although social stratiﬁcation is less
marked than in preceding historical periods, the blurring of
class boundaries and increasing social mobility raises the
likelihood of uncertainty about one’s social and economic
standing. Moreover, accompanying the rapid growth of
borrowed money, the focus on an idealized, prosperous self
is repeatedly primed by the media and in everyday discourse
(Dittmar, 2008). Yet, surprisingly, no previous study known
to us has tested the role of strategic presentation of status
symbols to others in symbolic self‐completion.
The current study was designed both to document the
phenomenon of status projection, and to examine socioeco-
nomic and psychological predictors of the magnitude of this
behavior, among adolescents who had grown up during a
period of economic growth. Data were collected early in 2006,
following 13 years of sustained growth in the UK economy
(International Monetary Fund, 2010). Participants were from
two neighboring towns in the county of Surrey, an afﬂuent
and desirable region of South East England. As an indicator of
this, average house prices in Surrey had grown slightly above
the national trend during the years preceding the study, rising
from 155% of the average for England and Wales in January
1995 to 162% in January 2006 (Land Registry, 2010).
Adolescents in the UK typically are already active
participants in consumer culture, with levels of disposable
income comparable with those of most adults and showing
somewhat higher endorsement of materialistic values than do
adult samples (Dittmar, 2005b). Yet, most are still in full‐time
education and not yet participating fully in the labor market.
Adolescents’ SES may be inferred from that of their families—
indexed by markers such as the occupational status, income, and
educational level of their parents (Liberatos, Link, & Kelsey,
1988). Yet, the adolescents’ own position on the same markers
remain uncertain—their personal SES is quite literally
“incomplete”—and so, claims to a particular status may need
symbolic reinforcement through strategic self‐presentation.
Braun and Wicklund’s (1989) studies of conspicuous
consumption focused on self‐reports of possessions owned, of
the perceived prestige of one’s consumer choices, and of how
one might appear to others. In contrast, we wanted to develop a
measure that reﬂected more precisely our theoretical deﬁnition
of status projection as a communicative strategy of selectively
presenting to others those of one’s material possessions that best
serve as status symbols. We asked participants to list a number
of material possessions that they owned, and to rate each for its
value as a status symbol. Yet, owning status‐relevant posses-
sions does not necessarily mean that these possessions are
emphasized in self‐presentation. Hence, we led our participants
to believe that they would be discussing a subset of their material
possessions with another participant in a subsequent social
interaction task, and we recorded their choices of which
possessions to discuss with the other participant. Reﬂecting
our theoretical deﬁnition of status projection, we predicted (H1)
that participants would tend to choose especially those of their
possessions that they perceived to have greater status value.
Based on our discussion of symbolic self‐completion
processes, we tested the role of several potential socioeconomic
and social psychological moderators of the magnitude of the
status projection effect. We measured participants’ family SES as
well as their perceptions of SES change, testing for linear and
curvilinear effects of both variables; in particular, we predicted
(H2) a curvilinear effect of perceived SES change—such that
status projection would be greater among those reporting less
stable SES—whether upwardly or downwardly mobile. As an
index of identity incompleteness not speciﬁc to SES, we included
a measure of the size and subjective importance of participants’
self‐discrepancies, predicting (H3) that status projection would
be greater among those with greater self‐discrepancies. Addi-
tionally, we measured participants’ internalization of material-
istic values, predicting (H4) that status projection would be
greater among those with stronger materialistic values.
Finally, we tested two possible accounts of the moderating
role of materialistic values. Reﬂecting the original formulation
of symbolic self‐completion theory, we predicted (H5) that the
effect of perceived SES change would be stronger among
participants endorsing more materialistic values—on the basis
that instability in this domain would only be problematic for
individuals who were committed to SES as a valued identity
domain. Following subsequent theorizing (e.g., Dittmar, 2008),
we predicted (H6) that the effect of general self‐discrepancies
also would be stronger among those with greater commitment
to materialistic values—reasoning that materialistic values
would make status projection a more appealing self‐completion
strategy for those experiencing identity incompleteness,
irrespective of the original domain of the incompleteness.

(US equivalent: ﬁnal 2 years of high school) in the county of
Surrey. Students were approached during classes and asked to
give 15 to 20 minutes to complete a questionnaire. Participants
were informed of their right to withdraw, and that data would
be kept strictly conﬁdential and anonymous except where
indicated,1 and they signed to indicate their consent. On
completion, participants were debriefed and questions were
invited. After revealing the deception, participants were given
an opportunity to withdraw their data; however, none did so.
Measures
Self‐discrepancies were measured using an idiographic–
nomothetic approach validated by Halliwell and Dittmar
(2006). Participants were asked to consider things about
themselves that they would like to change, and then completed
the sentence “I am…, but I would like …” up to seven times
(e.g., “I am overweight but I would like to be thin”, “I am
single but I would like to have a boyfriend”). They then rated
each statement for how different they were from their ideal
(magnitude), and how concerned they were about this gap
(importance), from 1 (a little) to 6 (extremely). A self‐
discrepancy index was calculated from the summed products
of the magnitude and importance ratings for each statement,
divided by the number of statements reported. Scores ranged
from 0 to 36, with higher scores indicating larger and more
psychologically important self‐discrepancies.2
Materialistic values were measured using the short‐form
material values scale (Richins, 2004), which includes 15 items
(6 reverse‐coded; α = .83) reﬂecting three facets of material-
ism: acquisition centrality (e.g., “I like a lot of luxury in my
life.”), acquisition in the pursuit of happiness (e.g., “I’d be
happier if I could afford to buy more things.”) and possessions
as deﬁnitions of success (e.g., “The things I own say a lot
about how well I’m doing in life.”). Items were rated from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree), and scores ranged
from 2.20 to 6.27.
Socioeconomic status was measured using two commonly
used indicators: occupational status of the main wage‐earner in
the household, and educational attainment of the highest
achieving parent or guardian (see Liberatos et al., 1988). We
did not ask about household income as we doubted that
participants would be able to report this accurately. Occupa-
tional status was measured using the self‐coded version of the
standard classiﬁcation of occupations used in British national
statistics, yielding ﬁve classes ranging from 1 (managerial and
professional occupations) to 5 (semi‐routine and routine
occupations) (Ofﬁce of National Statistics, 2002). Scores were
recoded, so that higher numbers indicated higher status.
Categories of educational attainment were derived from the
Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development
(OECD) standard classiﬁcation of educational qualiﬁcations
(Organisation for Economic Co‐operation and Development,
1999), ranging from 1 (no formal qualiﬁcations) to 9
(doctorate/PhD). These two indices were moderately correlated
(r = .40). Since we were not interested in differentiating
between occupational and educational aspects of SES, we
used the mean of the standardized scores on these two
measures for our analyses. Scores ranged from −2.50 to +1.15,
with higher values indicating higher SES.
Perceived SES change was measured using two newly‐
written items. We asked participants to compare their parents’
or guardians’ social and economic circumstances with those of
their grandparents, and to compare their parents’ or guardians’
current social and economic circumstances with their past
circumstances, using a scale of 1 (much better off) to 5 (much
worse off), with 3 representing stability. Scores were
subsequently reversed so that higher scores indicated more
upward mobility. The two ratings were moderately correlated
(r = .30). Since both ratings showed a similar pattern of
linear and curvilinear associations with the other study
variables, we measured perceived SES change as the mean
of the two ratings. Scores ranged from 1 to 5 with higher
scores indicating upward mobility, lower scores indicating
downward mobility, and intermediate scores reﬂecting relative
stability. Since we were interested in curvilinear as well as
linear effects of this variable, scores were centered before
analysis to reduce the multicollinearity between linear and
quadratic terms (Pedhazur, 1982).
Measurement of status projection involved three stages.
First, each participant freely listed 10 possessions that they
owned (e.g., “iPod”, “ring”, “teddy bear”). We gave no
examples and provided no cues about the sorts of possessions
that might be listed to avoid biasing or constraining responses.
Second, participants rated each of their possessions on nine
dimensions. Among six ﬁller questions, three items (α = .76)
referred to ways that the possessions might confer “status”
within society or within the respondent’s peer group: “To
what extent do you think that other people would view each of
these things as a ‘status symbol?’ ”; “To what extent does each
of these possessions project the image of a successful
person?”; “If you were without each of these things, to what
extent would you feel less advantaged amongst your peer
group?”, rated from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely). These
items were averaged to measure the perceived “status value”
of each possession.
Third, participants were asked to participate in a (ﬁctitious)
short follow‐up study which would involve discussing ﬁve of
their ten listed possessions with another participant. We gave
no further information about the nature or purpose of the
interaction task, so as not to bias participants’ choices of
which possessions to present to the other participant. All but
ﬁve participants agreed to take part, and listed their ﬁve
chosen possessions in preparation. Although we did not probe
systematically for suspicion, many participants expressed their
surprise on being told afterwards that there would be no
follow‐up study. This provides some conﬁdence that partici-
pants typically believed they were committing to discuss their
chosen possessions in a genuine social interaction.
Status projection was measured as the extent to which
possessions chosen for the interaction task had higher
associations with social status than did those that were not
chosen. As a rough‐and‐ready individual difference measure
(see Table 1), we subtracted the mean perceived status value
1This was inserted to support the deception in the status projection measure. In
reality, participants had full anonymity.
2A few participants listed no self‐discrepancies, claiming subsequently that
they could think of no ways they would like to be different. Hence, we
assigned them a score of zero on this measure. Analyses excluding these
participants showed a similar pattern of results to those reported.

of those possessions that each participant had not chosen from
the mean perceived status value of those that they had chosen.
Scores ranged from −1.80 to 4.27, with a mean of 1.09
(SD = 1.24).
However, this measure ignores the variability in status
ratings among possessions within each of the two categories
(those that have been chosen and those that have not been
chosen). A difference of one scale‐point has a very different
interpretation if possessions are closely clustered around the
mean within each category, to its interpretation if possessions
within each category are widely distributed: in the former
case, it may be possible to predict perfectly which
possessions a participant has chosen based on their perceived
status value, in the latter case hardly at all. Thus, removing
possession‐level variance misrepresents the level of analysis
of the status projection effect, which is likely to bias
estimates of its magnitude and signiﬁcance in unknown ways.
To avoid this potential bias, we used multilevel regression for
our main analyses (Hox, 2002), which allowed us to model
simultaneously effects at the level of material possessions
(level 1), effects at the individual level (level 2), and
interactions between effects at the two levels (cross‐level
interactions). We modeled status projection as a level 1 (i.e.,
within‐participant) main effect, which might be moderated by
cross‐level interactions with our level 2 (i.e., individual
differences) measures.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows zero‐order correlations among individual‐level
variables. Our rough‐and‐ready individual differences measure
of status projection was moderately associated with the squared
value of perceived SES change (suggesting greater status
projection among upwardly and downwardly mobile indivi-
duals than among those perceiving their SES as relatively
stable), self‐discrepancies (suggesting greater status projection
among individuals with greater self‐discrepancies), and
materialistic values (suggesting greater status projection among
individuals with stronger materialistic values). For multilevel
regression analyses, we used HLM 5.04 (Scientiﬁc Software
International, Inc., Lincolnwood, IL, USA) to conduct full
maximum likelihood estimation with convergence criterion of
0.000001. Signiﬁcance of ﬁxed effects was tested using robust
standard errors (Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong & Congdon,
2001). Tables 2 and 3 show the models tested.
Occurrence of Status Projection
To test for a general tendency towards status projection among
our participants (H1), we estimated the difference in perceived
status value between those possessions chosen for the
interaction task and those that were not chosen. To do this,
we regressed ratings of possession status on a dummy variable
distinguishing possessions chosen for the interaction task
(coded 1) from those that were not chosen (coded 0) (Model 1).
The ﬁxed slope was estimated at 1.10 (SE = 0.13, p < .001).
This indicates an average difference in perceived status value of
just over one scale‐point between the chosen and non‐chosen
possessions. Based on comparison with a null model omitting
this slope (Model 0), this model accounted for an estimated
10.2% of within‐participants variance on the status measure.
We now tested for individual variability in the size of this
effect, by estimating a random slope rather than a ﬁxed slope
for possession choice (Model 2). This provided a signiﬁcant
improvement in ﬁt compared with model 1, χ2 (2) = 10.77,
p < .01, indicating signiﬁcant heterogeneity in the size of the
status projection effect: individuals in our sample differed
signiﬁcantly in the extent to which their chosen and non‐
chosen possessions could be differentiated based on status.
Subsequent analyses were designed to identify individual‐
level predictors that might account for this variability. The

residual variance estimate for the possession choice slope,
τ2
slope, provides an estimate of unexplained variability in the
magnitude of the status projection effect. Hence, reductions in
τ2
slope in subsequent models could be used to derive estimates
of modeled variance in status projection.
Controlling for Socioeconomic Status
Our next model was designed to control for linear and
curvilinear effects of SES. In this and subsequent models,
effects on status projection were estimated as cross‐level
interaction effects, where individual‐level variables were
introduced as level 2 predictors of variability in the level 1
slope for possession choice. Following standard procedure for
testing interaction effects in multiple regression (Aiken & West,
1991), we included the underlying main effects in our models
alongside the theoretically important interaction effects. Hence,
we included both linear and quadratic terms for SES as main
effects on the status ratings and as cross‐level interactions
predicting variation in the status projection effect (Model 3).
Model 3 provided a non‐signiﬁcant improvement in model ﬁt,
χ2 (4) = 4.02, p = .40, and accounted for only an estimated 3.3%
of individual variability in status projection. None of the added
parameters reached signiﬁcance, although the quadratic main
effect of SES approached signiﬁcance, suggesting a marginal
tendency among those of highest and lowest SES to make
higher status ratings in general, compared with those of average
SES. We retained these parameters in subsequent models to
control for SES while testing our theoretical predictions.
Testing Moderation Effects of Socioeconomic Status
Change, Self‐discrepancies and Materialistic Values
To test H2 to H4, we now introduced perceived SES change
(linear and quadratic terms), self‐discrepancies, and material-
istic values as main effects on the status ratings and as cross‐
level interactions predicting individual differences in the
magnitude of the status projection effect (Model 4). All
predictors were centered on their grand means. Model 4
showed a highly signiﬁcant improvement in ﬁt compared with
the preceding model, χ2 (8) = 42.69, p < .001, and accounted
for an estimated 77.0% of individual variability in the status
projection slope. A signiﬁcant main effect of materialistic
values (β = .41, p < .001) indicated that participants with more
materialistic values tended to rate their possessions in general
as higher in status value than did those with less materialistic
values. However, our main hypothesis tests were in the cross‐
level interaction effects. Supporting H2, this model showed a
signiﬁcant interaction of possession choice with the quadratic
term for perceived SES change (β = .41, p < .05). Figure 1
shows variation in the status projection effect as a function of
the reported direction of change. As predicted, the effect was

Note. SES, socioeconomic status.
To aid interpretation of effect sizes, we have estimated values of β by multiplying unstandardized parameters by the SD of the predictor and dividing by the SD of
the outcome (Hox, 2002). For main effects, outcome SDs were derived from levels 1 and 2 variance components of the status ratings estimated in the null model.
For cross‐level effects, we treated the slope for possession choice as the “outcome” hence, we used the level 2 SD estimated for this slope in model 2 as our
outcome SD.

strongest among those reporting upward or downward
mobility, compared with those reporting relatively stable SES.
H3 was supported by a signiﬁcant interaction of possession
choice with self‐discrepancies (β = .38, p < .05); as shown in
Figure 2, status projection was signiﬁcantly greater among those
with greater self‐discrepancies. H4 was supported by a
signiﬁcant interaction of possession choice with materialistic
values (β = .54, p < .01); as shown in Figure 3, participants with
more materialistic values showed signiﬁcantly greater status
projection than did those with less materialistic values.
Incompleteness by Commitment Interactions
Finally, we tested the predicted interactions between materi-
alistic values and our two indices of incompleteness: SES
change and self‐discrepancies (H5 and H6). After centering
materialistic values and self‐discrepancies, we computed
cross‐product terms of materialistic values with linear and
quadratic terms for SES change, and with self‐discrepancies.
We entered all three cross‐product terms as main effects and
as cross‐level interaction terms predicting variation in the
status projection effect (Model 5). Although only a marginally
signiﬁcant improvement over Model 4, this model accounted
for an estimated 88.9% of variability in the status projection
slope, another substantial increase in modeled variance.
Crucially, as predicted, the model showed a signiﬁcant
3‐way interaction between materialistic values, the quadratic
term for perceived SES change and possession choice (β = .62,
p < .05). Figure 4 shows the estimated magnitude of the status
projection effect as a function of perceived SES change and
materialistic values. Supporting H5, the curvilinear effect of
perceived SES change on status projection was stronger
among those with higher materialistic values. We then
recomputed Model 5 using various linear transformations of
perceived SES change to establish under which circumstances
materialistic value endorsement showed a signiﬁcant effect on
status projection (Aiken & West, 1991). Materialistic values
were signiﬁcantly related to status projection at SES change
scores of 2 or below (downward change) and at scores of 4.5
or above (upward change); however, materialistic values were
not signiﬁcantly associated with status projection at values
between 2.5 and 4 (representing relatively stable or slightly
improved SES). Similarly, we used various transformations of
materialistic values to establish under which circumstances

perceived SES change was a signiﬁcant curvilinear predictor
of status projection. SES change was a signiﬁcant curvilinear
predictor of status projection at materialistic value scores of
3.7 or above (close to the theoretical midpoint of 4).
In contrast, the interaction effect involving generalized
self‐discrepancies was non‐signiﬁcant and close to zero
(β = .00, p = .99). Thus, against H6, there was no evidence to
suggest that the effect of generalized self‐discrepancies on
status projection was moderated by materialistic values.3
DISCUSSION
In this study, we documented the self‐presentational phenom-
enon of status projection: participants chose to present to
others especially those of their material possessions that they
associated with higher SES. Previous research into self‐
evaluation and impression management has typically focused
on individual or interpersonal qualities such as competence or
likeability as value dimensions (see Schlenker, 2003;
Sedikides & Gregg, 2003), paying little attention to social
structural conceptions of value often examined elsewhere in the
social sciences (for exceptions, see Dittmar, 1992; Gecas &
Schwalbe, 1983; Heine, Harihara, & Niiya, 2002). However,
the present results highlight the importance of SES as a valued
identity domain, even among adolescents in an individualistic
society during the historical period of late modernity (Giddens,
1991). Indeed, as social structures become more ﬂuid, this
arguably makes judgments and portrayals of SES more
amenable to the cognitive and self‐presentation biases
involved in motivated identity construction.
We used symbolic self‐completion theory (Wicklund &
Gollwitzer, 1982) to predict individual differences in status
projection. Previous research has supported a symbolic self‐
completion account of the acquisition of material possessions
(Dittmar, 2005a) and of cognitions about one’s possessions
and consumer choices (Braun & Wicklund, 1989), but this was
the ﬁrst study to test a symbolic self‐completion account of
actual behavioral choices about which of one’s material
possessions to present to others. Results supported two discrete
pathways to status projection, reﬂecting different forms of
identity incompleteness: status projection was signiﬁcantly
enhanced (1) among those reporting either upward or
downward change in SES, but only to the extent that they
endorsed materialistic values; and (2) among those reporting
greater self‐discrepancies, irrespective of materialistic values.
Symbolic self‐completion studies have often operationa-
lized identity incompleteness in terms of being new to a
particular identity position (e.g., Braun & Wicklund, 1989).
Although we did not measure potential mediators here, we
propose that members of upwardly mobile families may have
felt relatively uncertain of their elevated social status—
especially in the context of social discourse about “old” and
“new money”—increasing their need to display their social
status to others in search of self‐veriﬁcation (Swann, 1983).
We focused here on past‐to‐present improvement in SES,
but it would be interesting to explore whether expected
present‐to‐future improvement may have similar effects.
Guimond and Dambrun (2002) found that participants led to
expect future improvements in their economic circumstances
showed increased prejudice and ethnocentrism, although they
did not consider symbolic self‐completion as a possible
explanation. Future research might test whether participants
expecting future improvements in SES would also show
increased status projection.
Status projection was higher also among participants
reporting downward change in SES. For these participants,
status projection may have been driven by somewhat different
concerns, perhaps involving self‐continuity maintenance
(Chandler, Lalonde, Sokol, & Hallett, 2003). Although status
projection appeared stronger among downwardly mobile than
among upwardly mobile participants, this is not certain from
the current analyses—only that the effect of perceived SES
change was signiﬁcantly curvilinear. In fact, relatively few
participants were located at the downward end of the SES
change continuum—perhaps reﬂecting historically rising
levels of afﬂuence or else some normative bias in the self‐
report scale. Guimond and Dambrun (2002) also found some
evidence for increased prejudice among participants led to
expect future decline in their economic circumstances—
although in their studies the effects were weaker than those of
expected improvement.
Supporting symbolic self‐completion theory, the curvilin-
ear relationship between perceived SES change and status
projection was strongest among those who more strongly
endorsed materialistic values (Figure 4). Materialistic values
entail commitment to SES as an important identity domain;
hence, it may be only among relatively materialistic people
that SES change is problematic for identity, creating the
need for status projection. Consistent with this reasoning,
perceived SES change was associated with greater status
projection only among participants with materialistic values
scores of 3.7 or above—showing neutral or positive
endorsement of materialistic values. Thus, perceived SES
change did not predict status projection among those who
rejected materialistic values.
We should acknowledge that we did not measure directly
how people felt about the change or stability they reported in
their SES. Theoretically, one might expect that those reporting
either upward or downward change would show some indication
of insecurity—such as feelings of uncertainty or discomfort—
and that these feelings would mediate effects of the incomplete-
ness on status projection. However, such feelings may be
difﬁcult to detect, especially in a correlational study, because
participants in a position of incompleteness would be expected
already to have used one or more self‐completion strategies to
avoid or resolve such feelings. Hence, future research should use
experimental methods, as well as implicit measures, to attempt
to detect such feelings at the moment they occur and without
participants necessarily having to verbalize them.
Interestingly, sources of identity insecurity unrelated to SES
were also linked to status projection. Controlling for the main
and interactive effects of SES change and materialistic values
predicted by symbolic self‐completion theory, a generalized
measure of actual‐ideal self‐discrepancies predicted additional
3The interaction of materialistic values with the quadratic term for SES change
remained signiﬁcant in a model excluding the interaction with self‐discrepancies,
and the interaction of materialistic values with self‐discrepancies remained non‐
signiﬁcant in a model excluding the interactions with SES change.

variance in status projection. Unlike perceived SES change,
the self‐discrepancy measure asked participants explicitly to
report on feelings of identity incompleteness. Admittedly, if
people often seek to hide or compensate for their insecurities,
then self‐reports of the magnitude and importance of self‐
discrepancies may underestimate the true extent of identity
insecurity among participants. In particular, refusing to list
any self‐discrepancies may have been a defensive position
reﬂecting high, rather than low, incompleteness. This could
have inﬂuenced our results, weakening the observed relation-
ship between self‐discrepancies and status projection. Still, if
this was the case, it would make the current signiﬁcant ﬁnding a
conservative estimate of the true effect.
Notably, this second pathway to status projection was not
moderated by materialistic values. This helps us discriminate
between two possible understandings of the role of identity
commitment in symbolic self‐completion processes. On the
one hand, identity commitment may be involved in
determining the extent to which incompleteness in a given
domain is experienced as problematic, leading to psycholog-
ical insecurity and attempts at self‐completion; on the other
hand, identity commitment may be involved in determining
the extent to which a given behavior represents an attractive
strategy for self‐completion, irrespective of the initial source
of incompleteness. The former account is consistent with the
interaction of materialistic values and SES change observed in
the current data; in contrast, the latter conceptualization was not
supported here: materialistic values did not interact with
generalized self‐discrepancies to predict status projection. A
purely methodological explanation for the lack of a signiﬁcant
interaction seems unlikely here. Materialistic values and self‐
discrepancies were only moderately correlated (r = .29), and so
there remained a scope to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant interaction without
creating problems of multicollinearity. As Wicklund and
Gollwitzer (1982) recognize, individuals strive for recognition
on self‐deﬁning aspects that are validated by the community.
Thus, people experiencing insecurity may sometimes use status
symbols because of society’s readiness to respond to them,
irrespective of their personal values.
We are not proposing that status projection is the only goal
involved in the use of material possessions for identity
construction. Possessions may be important to people for
many reasons—including esthetic pleasure, prestige, self‐
esteem, social afﬁliation, differentiation, and continuity over
time (McIntosh & Schmeichel, 2004; Pearce, 1992; Vignoles,
Dittmar, Langton, Wright & Anderson, 2007)—and they may
likely be presented to others for a similarly wide variety of
reasons. Although we camouﬂaged our status ratings among
ﬁller items, making these ratings could possibly have
increased the salience of status concerns, cueing participants
to select high status possessions for the interaction task.
Nevertheless, this would not explain the detailed pattern of
cross‐level interactions we found, showing that the magnitude
of the status projection effect varied predictably as a function
of SES change, self‐discrepancies and materialistic values.
Because of its correlational methodology, the current study
does not permit strong causal inferences. Although the results
supported our theoretical predictions, they are also consistent
with some alternative causal explanations—for example that a
tendency towards status projection leads to identity insecurity.
We should reiterate that our main aims in this study were to
document the existence of the phenomenon of status projection
and to explore patterns of individual differences in a relatively
naturalistic format, not to test predictions about causal
sequence. Ample experimental evidence exists to support the
causal direction of symbolic self‐completion processes in other
domains (e.g., Gollwitzer & Wicklund, 1985; Ledgerwood et
al., 2007), as well as for defensive responses to identity threats
more generally (reviewed by Sedikides & Gregg, 2003). Still, it
would be valuable to use an experimental approach in future
research to test the causal antecedents of status projection, as
well as to test the effectiveness of status projection as a strategy
for resolving feelings of incompleteness.
We should acknowledge that the present sample was not
representative of British society as a whole. Earlier, we noted
reasons to expect that status projection may be especially
prevalent among adolescents—who typically strongly endorse
materialistic values, but whose SES is not yet deﬁned by
occupying a position within the labor market. Moreover,
participants were sampled from a relatively afﬂuent geo-
graphical area, which may have reduced our ability to detect
effects of SES. Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence suggests that
status projection is not restricted to afﬂuent adolescents, but
occurs among adults of various backgrounds, especially when
experiencing rising afﬂuence (Goffman, 1951; Smith, 2003).
Moreover, the conditions of late modern society resonate with
the characteristics of those participants in the current research
among whom greater status projection was observed.
Research has documented the increasing prevalence of
materialistic values in Western cultures (e.g., Kasser et al.,
2004). The breakdown of traditional class structures and
availability of borrowed money have led to increased social
mobility and higher socioeconomic aspirations among adults
as well as adolescents, allowing for greater insecurity about
one’s SES and greater latitude for using status symbols to
rectify such insecurity (Dittmar, 2008; Giddens, 1991).
To conclude, the present study offers a valuable ﬁrst look at
the self‐presentational strategy of status projection. Our results
relate this phenomenon to insecurity in the self‐concept,
instability of SES and the materialistic values that are prevalent
in contemporary mass consumer society. Perhaps, for those
living in contexts of rising afﬂuence, some solace can be taken
from the idea that those individuals engaged in status projection
are not necessarily attempting to make others feel inadequate,
but attempting to make themselves feel adequate.
