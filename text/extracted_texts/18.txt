My to-do list
for March
The things I’ll be planning, doing 
and shopping for this month
C
hores are on my mind, with a
big spring-cleaning binge on
the horizon, shopping trolleys
to test and new decorating 
colour schemes to plan…
SPRING CLEANING I tend to be a bit
of a sluggard over the winter months,
but once it’s warm enough to keep the
windows open I get the energy up to
tackle the Big Jobs. Saturday mornings
(after a stiff treble espresso to gird the
loins) will find me in the back garden
shaking clouds of dust out of curtains, on
my hands and knees scraping carbonised
pizza cheese off the oven floor, or
scrubbing the Venetians with a damp,
inside-out sports sock on each hand. You
never really know a house until you’ve
poked your vacuum’s dusting attachment
into all its nooks and crannies, or marked
your territory with spray and polish.
Always on the hunt for a game changer,
I’ll pick a new cleaning product to give
a proper try-out: this year I want to see  
if Lakeland’s Bio-Mex multipurpose
cleaner (£9.98) betters my long-time
favourite, JML’s Doktor Power (£4.99).
BEING A TROLLEY DOLLY I need a
new shopping trolley. I bought a proper
granny-style one years ago, being
car-free in London and struggling home
from Camden Morrisons with a bag of
groceries hanging from every finger.
Once, a friend hid my garden gnome in
it and I had to take him out and stand him 
on the checkout before I
could pack my shopping,
to the amusement of all
around. But the frame broke
during my last house move
and now the 5p plastic bag
charge has forced the issue. 
I’m weighing up my
options, having seen a cute
retro-flower-print one in
Lakeland (£39.99) but also
considering splashing out
on a rather lovely wicker one
(£72) from prettymaison.co.uk. Either way,
I’ll be the envy of the farmers’ market!
BUYING INTO COLOUR As a child of
the Seventies, I have a deep affinity for
bold colours that the ‘magnolia years’
failed to quash. When I first saw the new
spring/summer homeware ranges on the
high street, it lifted my heart to see so
much colour. Trends aside, in my eyes,
the biggest story in interiors right now
is colour – and how our attitudes to it
are changing. From big, splashy florals
and Rio 2016-inspired tropical tones
to smooth Pantone colour of the year,
Rose Quartz, the delicious colours will
be hard to resist this year, even for the
most faithful neutrals fan!

Shape up
Simply does it
So Sottsass
plate, £80,
Darkroom
London 
THE STORY SO FAR The
Memphis Group began life in
Milan in the early Eighties. It
was founded by Ettore Sottsass
alongside other architects and
designers, with the aim to create
products to counteract minimalist
design. Inspired by Bauhaus,
pop art and African textiles,
the collective added a graphic
dimension to furniture and fabric
using block shapes in colourful
combinations. Today’s homeware
designers are now revisiting this
playful style and its signature
palette of punchy pastels, warm
yellows and striking black accents.
WHERE WE’VE SEEN IT Italian
furniture company Kartell
showcased never-before-seen
furniture, lighting and vases
designed for Kartell by Sottsass at
Milan Design Week in 2015. Since
then, designer shop Darkroom 
London has paid tribute to
the movement with Sottsass-
inspired plates, cushions and
stationery. Ferm Living has also
given a nod to the style, using
inky blue and grey to refresh its
geometric prints, while Laura
Slater’s textile designs include
more relaxed layers and lines
to bring the look up to date.
LATEST RELEASES German
brand Hem landed in London
last year – check out its Alphabeta
lights and textiles featuring grid
patterns and confetti designs.
Habitat went all-out with a bold
Memphis-inspired collection
last season; new this year are the
more subtle Malo oak shelving
unit, the geometric Silo rug
and the Leri and Pepae vases.
Also worth a look are Giannina
Capitani Studio’s Tic-Tac and

range, Sainsbury’s
Andrew Tanner,
design manager
at Sainsbury’s
You might not think of heading to
the supermarket to stock up on chic
dinnerware, but the new Copenhagen
collection at Sainsbury’s will make
you think again. The store’s in-house
designers have taken inspiration from
the mid-century modern movement to
create gorgeous patterned plates and
bowls with a hand-drawn, illustrative
feel, as well as geometric-printed 
linens in buttery tones and striking
monochromes. Layered together, they
create a dining table with wow factor. 
It’s not a style that will date any
time soon and can be incorporated
alongside your existing plain crockery.
Prices start at just £3 for a side plate
and as the range will be expanding
across lighting, stationery, cushions
and even bedding, it’s easy and 
affordable to bring this distinctive
trend to all areas of your home.
More inspiring homeware
collections are in the pipeline from
Sainsbury’s later this year, and the
company will be dedicating even more
floor space to non-food products, with
more local stores stocking the home
living ranges. Your weekly shop
just got a whole lot more stylish.
Sainsbury’s has nailed upscale
Scandi style (and it starts at £3!) 
‘Warming mustard tones are given 
a bold edge with accents of black,
while contemporary geometrics
are complemented by artisanal
glassware in the Copenhagen range’

DESIGN REPORT

housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine MARCH 2016
March SHOPPING IDEAS
F
iona Lambert, vice
president of product design
and development of Asda’s
George range, has worked
alongside its founder,
George Davies, from the beginning. 
‘When we launched the George
clothing range in 1990, Asda was the
first supermarket to sell clothes and
now it’s the third-biggest supermarket
clothing retailer,’ she says. ‘With this
success, we saw an opportunity to
provide our customers with the same
quality and design credentials in an
inspirational range of homeware,
making it as easy and affordable
for them to update a home as it  
is to update a wardrobe.’
As well as overseeing a  
team of designers and
buyers, Fiona conducts
research into trends,
interpreting them into
inspiring products. The
new spring/summer
2016 collection covers
six key themes, from
an Italian-inspired
look to a celebration
of British wildlife
and country gardens. ‘I’m really
proud of the collections,’ says Fiona.
‘They prove that you can deliver great 
design at an affordable price.’   
THE WOMAN BEHIND THE LOOK
Born in the Midlands, Fiona grew up
close to both towns and countryside.
‘As a child, I was very arty – I used to
draw and paint,’ she says. ‘I was raised
to appreciate the countryside, and
enjoyed picking and pressing wild
flowers. My mum was a dressmaker, so
I was surrounded by clothes and made
mini versions for my dolls. I’ve still got 
a sketchbook of my designs from when
I was 11 – they would be spot-on trend
now with the Seventies revival!’
A good all-rounder at school, Fiona
set her heart on being a designer
and decided to do a degree in fashion
design at Nottingham Trent University.
‘When I left university, I got a job as
a designer and pattern cutter at Next,’
she says. ‘The company was growing
rapidly and I learnt a lot. I was very
lucky to work with George Davies
there. I consider him my mentor.
He’s the person who has most heavily
influenced my career – he set the bar
high on performance and it was a
sink-or-swim environment, but he gave
me the best opportunities and it was
an environment that I flourished in.’
The turning point
in Fiona’s career came
when George asked her
to work with him on
a new project in 1989.
‘He said, “I can’t tell you
who it’s for, I can’t tell
you what it is, but it’s
going to be exciting”,’
she says. ‘So I decided
it was worth the risk to
be part of something entrepreneurial
and new, and I went for it.’
Since then, George has changed the
way customers shop. ‘The growth of
online purchases and social media
means that customers demand
constant newness,’ says Fiona. ‘I’m very
focussed on the customer and believe
in innovation – that’s how you stay
successful. It’s about trying to create
products that make life easier.’
A PEACEFUL HOME
Fiona has lived in Leicester since
1986 and shares her Arts and Crafts 
house with her husband and children 
– daughter, Georgia, 22, and son
Charlie, 19. ‘My house is very light
and airy with lots of windows and
a beautiful garden,’ she says. ‘It’s
definitely my sanctuary from a very
hectic life. It is quite calming and I
try to keep it simple with pale colours
and signature accessories, then add
cushions and paintings for personality.
‘I believe you should buy carefully
and buy well, and invest in beautiful
homeware. You can change your
clothing every day, but you’re going
to walk into a room and see the same
things, so you’ve got to love them.
I take joy from the paintings and
decorative accessories I’ve bought,
and placing them against a neutral
backdrop helps them to really sing.’

GET TO
KNOW HER
SIGNATURE
STYLE Having
worked in fashion
for 30 years, much 
of Fiona’s interiors inspiration
comes from textiles and the world
of fashion. ‘To work in design,
I think you have to be a human
sponge for everything around you
– whether it’s travel, world cultures,
other designers, the catwalk or art
exhibitions,’ she says.
Fiona also believes that popular
art and entertainment is having
an increasing impact on people’s
taste and interior-design style.
‘TV is such a big part of everyone’s
lives now,’ she says. ‘Programmes,
such as Downton Abbey and
Indian Summers, have had a huge
influence, whether it’s a demand
FEATURE KAREN BRAY
for beautiful cut glass and crystal
or Indian-style furniture.’
Fiona’s motivation comes from
a very wide spectrum. ‘Having a
career in design means you never
really switch off and you find
inspiration in everything you see
and do,’ she explains. ‘As a team
at George, we gather inspiration
from lots of different places, then
it’s about how we edit and curate
that for people to be able to
visualise it in their homes. We
separate our personal taste from
our customers’ taste, as our role
is to think about what they would
like. The items we design won’t
necessarily be to my taste but
they will have my standards
of quality and integrity, and,
hopefully, they’ll include my love
of interior design and I can share
that with the customer, too.’

A keen cook, these
saucepans get plenty

1
Choose your base colour Whether
it’s ﬂooring or a wall, the base colour
will be the largest area of colour in your
room, so place a generous sample of it
onto your board. Including carpet samples
will help you think about texture, too.
2
Add an accent tone A dramatic
contrast or an accent just a few tones
away from your base colour? Use your
moodboard to play with options and
layer it with swatches of fabric, scraps
of wallpaper and paint colour charts.
3
Find the right accessories
These will really set the tone in your
room – go for ones that share an accent
colour and stick to a single theme. Don’t
mix styles, or your ﬁnished scheme will
look messy rather than efortlessly eclectic.

1
THE 70-20-10 RULE For a
balanced scheme, keep 70% of
the elements (say, walls and ﬂoors)
as one colour, then add 20% in
a second colour (fabrics) and
10% in an accent (accessories).
2
THE PATTERN RULE When
mixing patterns, use large with 
medium or medium with small,
never large with small. Pick prints
that share a colour in common.
3
THE PAINTED BOX RULE
The look of paint changes
according to the time of day and
the light in a room. Paint the inside
of a large box with a tester to create
a miniature ‘room’ and see how the
colour changes within a 3D space.
AND FINALLY… Always add
a surprise. A focal point – whether
it’s a feature wall or a piece of art
– is the short cut to a ‘wow’ room.

PARALLEL LINES
If you’d love to use a bold
colour but worry it’ll be too
much, try this trick: paint the
lower third of a wall and fake
a dado rail with a thin border
in a contrasting colour. We
painted a peg rail in the same
wall shade for extra impact.

There are so many great

a painted-effect pattern and
frame it with moulding,
painted to match. This is a
great way to mark out a ‘zone’

WHY WE LOVE THEM Muted
geometrics have a calm feel
thanks to their understated
palette, while their structured
patterns mean they’re still  
bold enough to create impact.
They make an ideal backdrop 
or a good statement point in
modern homes on which to
layer stronger colour and prints.
WHERE TO USE THEM Better
suited to large rooms or feature
walls, geometric wallpaper can
be used to smarten up a neutral
living or dining-room scheme,
where it will add a contemporary
touch while maintaining a
classic look. Soft designs create
a calm ambience in a bedroom 
– layer graphic cushions and
throws on plain white bedding 
for a cosy feel, or frame your
bed with an eye-catching
striking hexagon design. 
HOW TO USE THEM Some
intricate designs contain optical
illusions and create a 3D effect,
so use carefully. Patterned
textiles look very effective on
chairs, cushions and curtains,
but stick to a simple palette 
and prints of a similar size so
that the furnishings don’t clash
or compete with each other.
HOW TO ACCESSORISE 
THEM Team with linear pieces
such as multifaceted vases,
sculptural lighting and bold,
angular furniture. Geometric
rugs are a great way to inject  
a flash of pattern without
monopolising the space.
Choose neutral geometrics

THE COMPANY Based in western
Sweden, the Sandberg Studio designs
all of the Sandberg wallpapers in-house.
Each piece is hand drawn and painted, 
with colours and patterns that are
inspired by the Swedish landscape and
its native plants and animals, as well
as paying homage to the country’s
historical and cultural heritage. The
result is an original, contemporary
range of premium wallpapers infused
with a distinctive Swedish style.
THE NEW COLLECTION Taking
inspiration from designs spanning
two centuries, Tradition is a historical
collection of wallpapers from both
grand manor houses and humble
cottages. Comprising eight diverse 
designs, the collection is a stylish and
modern reinterpretation of wallpapers,
from rich 18th-century Rococo
and Gustavian styles through to a
reconstruction of a Twenties original.
Featuring nature-inspired flora,
fauna, birds and butterflies, as well as
symmetrical patterns and medallion
and stripe motifs, these timeless
designs will look equally at home today
as they did hundreds of years ago.
WHY WE LOVE IT This unique
collection gives a wonderful insight
into the wallpapers that once formed
the backdrop to Swedish life. From
soft neutrals to dainty blues, these
delicate prints are the perfect way  
to update a traditional look.

SMART IDEAS FOR
WINDOWS
Take down those dusty drapes and give
your windows a fresh new look for spring
O
ne of the easiest ways to
give a room a new look
is to update the window
treatment. Whether it’s
a colourful sweep of floral fabric
that brightens up a wintry room
come springtime, or statement-
making shutters in an unexpected
colour choice, it can make the
world of difference to a room.
Before you consider materials,
set aside the style options and think
first about the practicalities: the
size and shape of the windows;
how much light and privacy you
will need; and how much you
can afford to spend.
With these essentials in mind,
deciding on a style, pattern and
colour will fall into place more
easily. We’ve come up with some
bright new ideas and practical
advice to help you, so you can
create the look you want with ease.
IDEA
Try full-height
shutters as an
alternative to curtains
at ﬂoor-to-ceiling 
or French 
windows
Try a single panel
You don’t have to use two
curtains when one will do in  
a tight space. Use a single curtain
panel that can be closed at night
but swept back out of the way  
to maximise light during the day

MARCH 2016  housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine
Make a statement
Use colour as an eye-catching
alternative to traditional white or
wooden shutters, and create a
striking feature in a neutral room.
Add accessories in the same
colour to pull the look together
Blue louvred shutters, from £290
per sq m for standard colours,
or £320 per sq m for custom
finishes, Shutterly Fabulous
‘Make narrow
windows seem wider
by extending the
curtainpolepastthewindow
(around 30cm each side).
Pull back curtains to leave
most of the glass exposed’
LISA FAZZANI, SHOPPING EDITOR
A lace panel provides
privacy, diffuses the
light and gives a hint 
of vintage glam
For similar curtains, 
try the Alvine Spets, 
£10 per pair, Ikea
Customise ready-mades
or give old curtains  
a new lease of life  
by sewing on a cheery 
trim or fringing
For a similar  
pompom trim, try the
selection at Dunelm

Window updates  DECORATING IDEAS
Create symmetry
Unify a pair of side-by-side
windows by dressing them
identically. For a grand,
sumptuous effect, double up
with Roman blinds teamed with
floor-length curtains hung
from poles – a formal treatment
that suits tall, narrow windows
in period properties
Curtains in Harewood Dijon fabric,
from £235 for a W100 x L160cm
curtain; blinds in Sion Mimosa
fabric, from £166 for a W60 x
L60cm blind; both Style Studio
Add pattern to glazing
A more stylish option than
frosted or textured glass,
decorative film can help you
maintain privacy without
sacrificing natural light in your
room. Perfect for street-facing
windows or kitchens and
bathrooms where floaty voiles
or curtains might get in the way,
laser-cut patterns like this dotty
design add a decorative touch

there is one, or outside the

Window updates DECORATING IDEAS
KNOW YOUR CURTAIN HEADINGS
CARTRIDGE
A contemporary
version of the goblet,
the pleats form large,
cylindrical folds, not
sewn into place, to
give a more relaxed
look. It also suits
heavier fabrics.
PENCIL PLEATS
Suitable for tracks
or poles and most
fabrics, this simple
heading is made
using curtain tape,
which has cords that
are pulled to gather
the fabric into pleats.
TRIPLE PINCH
PLEATS
More formal than the
pencil style, these
pleats are held in
place with stitching.
It uses more fabric
in order to create a
fuller-looking curtain.
TAB TOPS
An informal heading
made with loops of
fabric sewn to the top
of a curtain panel.
Slips directly onto the
curtain pole and is
suitable for light and
heavyweight fabrics.
EYELET
Modern and unfussy,
this has metal eyelets

This sumptuous

formal rooms. It uses
more fabric than
standard pleats and
suits heavy fabrics.
Make a seasonal swap
It’s a good idea to swap heavy
winter drapes for something
lighter and airier in spring.
Make it a doddle with easy-
to-sew tie-top curtains in a
lightweight fabric. They’ll need
no linings, rings or tapes – you
simply tie them into place on

LOCATION Set across ﬁve Victorian
mansions on Pembridge Gardens,
The Laslett is less than a minute’s
walk from London’s Notting Hill Gate
tube station – which means it is ideal
for exploring the local scene, but is
within easy reach of the city centre.
ROOMS The Laslett has 51 bedrooms
that look and feel more like a friend’s
stylish town house than a hotel, and
range from cleverly compact ‘spare
rooms’ to super-spacious ‘master
bedroom suites’, giving the hotel
a home-from-home vibe. Modern
furniture from British names, such
as Pinch Design, sits alongside more
quirky items, including antique-shop
ﬁnds and photographs by local artists.
FAMOUS FOR Celebrating its local
heritage. In a neighbourhood as
fabled as Notting Hill, this newcomer
has its own tale to tell. Taking its
name from Rhaune Laslett, the
organiser of the Notting Hill Festival
(later retitled Carnival), and with its
Henderson Bar named after the late
jazz musician and local personality
Russell ‘Russ’ Henderson, the hotel
takes inspiration from the area’s
vibrant, cool culture.
CELEBRITY GUESTS Having only
opened late last summer, The Laslett
is too young to give the names of any
of its more notable guests. However,
being nestled in such an aluent and
trendy part of town, with stars such
as Stella McCartney, Robbie Williams
and Claudia Schifer all having homes
in the area, spotting a celeb while
you’re out and about should be easy.

Detached new build  HOME IDEAS
S
erial renovators Jo and Mark
Fitzgerald had lived in several
properties in their home city of
Birmingham, but the idea of a more
relaxed, rural lifestyle was always in
the back of their minds. ‘We wanted 
to improve our work-life balance,’ says Jo.  
‘A home by the sea and the outdoor life that
comes with it was always top of our wish list.’
But it was only when Jo was chatting with a
friend who had recently settled in Devon that
things started to fall into place. ‘She said, “Why
don’t you come here? It’s got everything you talk
about.” I knew that she was right,’ says Jo.
Within months, the couple had sold up and
were house-hunting in the county’s surfing
hotspot of Croyde. Things were challenging
from the start. ‘The high prices were a shock,’
says Jo. ‘There was limited choice within our
budget and, although we weren’t fazed by the
idea of doing work on a property, everything
we saw needed major refurbishment.’
They eventually bought a two-bedroom,
Seventies bungalow, with the idea of
modernising and extending it, but, as they 
discussed ideas with their builders, it became
clear that they’d have to rethink their plans.
‘The bungalow wasn’t especially well built 
or attractive, but it was on a good-sized plot,’
explains Jo. ‘We were advised to knock it down
and start again. Building a house had never
been on the agenda before, but there’s definitely
a frustrated designer in me. The prospect was
nerve-racking, but exciting, too.’
Working with an architect, Jo drew up plans
for a bold, contemporary, two-storey family
home. Her previous renovation projects had
given her plenty of experience when it came to
deciding how their new house should feel and
function. ‘In a previous property, we’d had a
separate dining room that we rarely went into,
and I learned from that,’ she says. ‘I think every
inch of a house should be lived in and used.’ 
A light-filled, open-plan kitchen, dining and
living area was a must-have, so too was a guest
suite, separate bedrooms for Finley, Leo and Eva,
and a TV room, where the children could relax.
Once the design was finalised and planning
permission granted, the family moved into a
short-term let. The bungalow was demolished ➺

a big “to-do” list every weekend, leaving no
time to meet new people, take the children
out or just relax. It was stressful for everyone.’
However, they pressed on and managed to
move in within the six months. Most of the
interior was still undecorated and the outside was
shrouded in weatherproof sheeting, but they had
heating, bedrooms and a functioning kitchen and
bathrooms. From then on, tasks were completed
as their finances allowed, and Jo did as much as
she could herself. ‘I couldn’t spend thousands on
a decorator, so I painted all the bare plaster walls,
which took about four weeks,’ she says. ‘My
elbows ached, but it just had to be done.’
Jo’s very personal interior style is a feast for
the eyes. Vibrant colours pop out against a
neutral backdrop, and iconic modern furniture
sits alongside weathered wooden pieces,
eye-catching artwork, feature lighting and
rustic, artisan pottery. She shops widely on
and the build began. Jo and Mark felt the
pressure from day one. They had just six months
to get the new house habitable, before their
rental contract expired. The pace was slower
than Jo had expected and, within weeks, their
budget was rapidly being reached. ‘Huge bills
were coming in and we were going to run out
of money if I didn’t do something,’ she says.
So, with Mark away working for much of the
time, Jo shouldered the task of project-managing
the build, overseeing finances and sourcing
all the materials. She spent her evenings online,
researching components and tracking down
the best prices for every item, from bath taps
to windows and guttering. During the day, she
worked alongside the building team, laying
underfloor heating pipes, fitting insulation and
shifting tonnes of building materials. ‘Labour
was a big part of the overall cost and we needed
to save money,’ she explains. ‘Mark and I had

With the house finally finished, the family
is now immersed in the local community
and enjoying the outdoor life they relocated
for. Jo has taken on a new challenge, running
a B&B from the house (ellevencroyde.co.uk),
with guests staying in the downstairs suite.
Looking back, the couple can see how they
could have made the building process easier, but
there are no regrets. ‘We weren’t well-prepared,
especially financially,’ Jo admits. ‘Even so, if we
hadn’t had that can-do attitude, we’d never have
achieved what we have. I’m proud of what we’ve
created and I can see us doing it again one day.’ IH

J
o and Dominic Arnold caught the
building bug while living in their
previous house – a Victorian villa
in East Sussex. ‘It was a top-to-
bottom refurbishment,’ explains Jo.
‘Our daughter, Georgia, was a baby
at the time and we ended up corralled in one
room for several months while the work took
place. Perversely though, we enjoyed it and
that’s what spurred us on to tackle other
projects, including our current home.’
Having worked on various properties in
and around the Brighton area for their work,
the couple increasingly appreciated the
charm and wonderful seaside location of
the town, and Jo spotted their present house
while she was viewing another one nearby.
‘Dominic and I were both really taken with it,’
she says. ‘It was in a quiet area, nestled between
two parks, not too far from the sea and within
walking distance of good schools. And, best
of all, there was plenty of scope to make this
property our own. After working on so many
other people’s homes, it was great to be able
to focus on creating something special for us.’
As managing director of his own property-
development company, Dominic and his
staff were used to dealing with demanding
clients. However, when he and Jo instructed ➺

adjoining bedroom, while the attic room
was replanned in order to fit in an en suite.
Jo was also keen to implement Dominic’s
idea of installing solar panels. ‘We wanted 
to minimise our carbon impact and,
simultaneously, reduce our energy bills,’ she
explains. ‘It is a long-term investment, of
course, but we have already seen a return.’
Another energy-saving idea the couple had
was to insulate the downstairs floor to reduce
draughts. ‘One of the things I enjoy most about
the house is the beautiful, exposed, original
floorboards,’ says Jo. ‘We didn’t want to lose
their Scandi look, so we took up the entire
floor, insulated below it and relaid it, so the
space is now super cosy and chic.’
However, the renovation wasn’t all plain
sailing. ‘When the wrong boiler was delivered,
it had a knock-on effect, stretching a six-week
timescale to 10 weeks,’ says Jo. ‘We also ➺
his firm, Cocoon Property, to redesign their
new house, expectations were understandably
rather high. ‘The team that worked on the
project told us we were their most “discerning” 
clients to date,’ says Jo. ‘I decided to take  
that as a compliment.’
Sensibly, the Arnolds decided to live in
the property for a year or so before doing any
work to it. This allowed them to decide how
best to use the space for their needs, and also
to see how the light would fall in the rooms 
at different times of the day.
It was time well spent, as they decided to
reconfigure some of the existing rooms and
build a small extension into the side return.
The work was relatively straightforward, as it
came within permitted development rights and,
therefore, didn’t require planning permission.
Thanks to the extension, the ground floor
now has a utility room, cloakroom and a wider
kitchen. The couple kept the front living room
as it was, but altered the rest of the downstairs
layout. ‘By demolishing the supporting wall
between the family room and hallway, we
created a large, open-plan living area,’ says Jo.
‘We kept the double-glazed doors between the
living room and the rest of the ground floor, so
we can open up the entire space if we want to.’
Upstairs, the couple enlarged the family
bathroom by taking a little space from an

‘With three daughters,
it’s important to maximise
storage, so our joiner
designed and built this

the fireplace, and Jo added interest by
introducing areas of pattern. ‘I made the bed
the focal point by adding large gingham
cushions and an embroidered quilt,’ she says.
In Daisy’s room, neutral grey gives way to
splashes of red and pink. ‘I enjoy hunting
for vintage finds that I can repurpose,’ says
Jo. ‘The armoire, chest of drawers and wall
unit are all restored second-hand pieces.’
Vintage furniture is also used in the main
bathroom, where Jo has combined classic and
contemporary looks to great effect. ‘I love the
modern take on a freestanding bath; it provides
the perfect contrast to the period-style taps and
painted vintage wall cabinet, while the bespoke
mirror doubles the sense of space,’ she says.
Having now lived for a decade in their
Brighton home, Jo is eager to take on more
challenges. ‘We’ve worked on so many
properties in the last 10 years and have so
many new ideas of our own – it would be good
to put them into practice,’ she says. ‘We
recently visited Morocco and brought back
some fabulous rugs and wooden pieces – and
that just inspires me all over again!’

Jo found the chair on
the pavement and had
it reupholstered. ‘I love
the nooks and crannies

chair is the perfect fit
for this corner,’ she says

had a continual leak into the kitchen ceiling,
which was a major concern until we traced it
to a faulty sash window in the room above.’
Once everything was repaired and the
builders had left, Jo was able to get started on
furnishing and decorating the interior of her
home. Her aim was to create a practical and
elegant space for modern family living, taking
inspiration from Scandi style, with cool neutral
shades and warm grey accents.
In the kitchen, Jo decided against wall units
to maximise the width of the room and to make
it feel more spacious. ‘Natural light here comes
from bifold doors that extend across the back
of the house, while mirrors around the room
maximise the light, especially the oversized
one in the family room,’ she says.
Sleek painted finishes continue into the
living room, which is a stylish, calm space with
dappled light filtering through the wooden
plantation shutters. ‘I love the unifying effect
of paint,’ says Jo. ‘You can get exactly the right
colour and finish – and it’s very hard-wearing,
too.’ In the main bedroom, the colour palette
was built around the grey marble surround of

17th-century cottage  HOME IDEAS

S
imon Shaw and Giuliana Cortese
live in a home that tells a story
– not just in the history that’s
embedded in the architecture of
their 17th-century cottage, but in
the new extension they’ve added,
too. ‘Our cottage is Grade-II listed,’ says Simon.
‘When renovating it, we resisted the temptation
to finish everything off perfectly, as it would be
hard to read the narrative of the property. For
example, we left parts of the original reed wall
uncovered and where we removed the old roof,
I left some of the rafters and old nails exposed.’
However, the glass-and-wood extension that
Simon and Giuliana added is dramatically
modern. ‘It was important to be clear that the
new part of the property was introducing our
story, so anyone who comes here – now or in
years to come – will understand how the
building was put together,’ explains Simon.
The couple had decided to move out of
London to a Buckinghamshire village in July
2008. When viewing their end-of-terrace
cottage, they immediately liked it and, although
very little had been changed over the previous
30-odd years, the property was a good size
with four bedrooms and a Fifties extension.
Simon, who trained as an architect, saw it
had great potential. ‘Upstairs had a good head
height instead of low beams, so I knew that ➺

units teamed with Carrara

‘We want every corner to be
invested with a story, so that our
home will always be evolving ’
if I introduced light into the building, it would
feel airy,’ he says. He was so keen to start on the
project, he drew up plans for the new extension
before the sale had even completed. ‘We had
£150,000 to spend and I had everything
planned out before we began,’ he says. ‘It was
actually better this way, as it meant there were
minimal changes on site.’
After the sale went through, the family
moved into the cottage, but it wasn’t easy to
live in at all. The Fifties extension leaked and
while the cottage walls were constructed from
traditional wychert (white clay mixed with
straw), their modern plastered finish trapped
moisture, which made the rooms damp.
Simon got started on the restoration work
straightaway, tackling the project room by
room, but continuing to work full time as
a creative director in London. Evenings and

‘We wanted this space  
to feel minimal and

weekends were spent stripping back the walls
and reinstating them with traditional lime
plaster and a lime finish that would allow them
to retain heat and breathe again.
During this time, Simon had a pre-planning
meeting with the local planner and historic-
buildings officer for the new rear extension. 
He showed them his 3D model of the two-
storey contemporary building, which would
become a new kitchen-diner with a bedroom
and bathroom above. ‘The extension is four
times as large as the old one, but it’s set away
from the neighbours to protect their light, 
with a flat roof to avoid adverse views from 
the street,’ Simon explains. ‘I talked about how 
the building would work for us as a family 
and they were both very receptive.’
It wasn’t until January 2011 that the old
extension was finally knocked down and ➺

Exterior
The ultramodern
extension complements
the historic property,
as it’s a contemporary
take on materials used
in the old cottage, with
timber frames instead
of exposed beams and
rendered walls instead of
limestone plastered ones
FEATURE JANE CRITTENDEN STYLING ANNA MORLEY PHOTOGRAPHS
ALISTAIR NICHOLLS BOX COPY LISA FAZZANI PLANS PERSONA-ID
the building work began. The oak timber
frame was put together on site by hand rather
than being constructed in a factory – a
deliberate design choice that was made by
Simon. ‘I wanted to use a modern interpretation
of the old materials in the new parts of the
house,’ he explains. ‘So the construction of
our new extension is a contemporary version 
of the old cottage’s timber frame.’
This concept is at the heart of the interiors,
too, where ideas spring from the materials used
in the architecture. ‘Simon doesn’t see the
architecture and interiors as being separate
things,’ says Giuliana. ‘The architecture became
the palette for the interiors. For example, the
grey polished concrete on the floor reflects the
grey millstone in the walls of the cottage.’
It’s a similar story throughout the property:
new oak and cedar sit alongside exposed old
beams and modern oak doors with stainless-
steel hardware stand next to reclaimed timber 
doors with black fixings, while rendered walls
emulate traditional limestone plastered walls.
One of the outstanding design features is the
steel bridge that links the old cottage with the
new extension, designed by Simon but inspired
by the work of Italian architect, Carlo Scarpa. 
‘We’ve visited Scarpa’s Querini Stampalia
Foundation in Venice many times,’ says Simon. 
‘We love the way the old and new have been
combined and see different details each time.’
Giuliana and Simon’s project took 15 months
to complete, allowing them to finish the next
chapter of the cottage’s architectural story.
The couple are delighted to see their home
grow and change with them. ‘We want the
interior to be a reminder of the history that
has gone on before, but also a reflection of our
family history that we’re still creating,’ says
Giuliana. ‘We want every corner to be invested
with a story, so that our home will always be
evolving as we add new pieces to it.’ IH

Unusual finds from other
countries add character

always looking for unique
pieces, bought the Indian

our Warsaw apartment, so our offer, which
was £10,000 less than the asking price, was
accepted, thankfully,’ says Alicja.
Although the house had been extended
previously, the couple felt the layout would
benefit from further rejigging to free up space
and access the all-important natural light. As
many of the neighbours had done, they started
off by turning an integrated garage into a guest
bedroom. Then a skylight was fitted on the
second-floor landing, through which light now
filters down the stairwell into the hallway. ‘Now,
instead of walking into a dark, gloomy entrance
hall, light streams through it,’ says Alicja.
Sliding glazed doors were fitted to the back
of the house to allow even more light to flood
in downstairs, and an open-plan area was
created on the ground floor, so that the

hen Alicja and Graham
Cockcroft relocated
back to the UK after
living in Poland, they
faced the challenge  
of finding a home that 
would be as large and airy as the new-build
apartment they’d had in Warsaw. ‘The windows
were huge and let in so much light,’ explains
Alicja. ‘Any future home had to have something
of the same style and lots of natural daylight.’
The couple rented a flat in Cambridge while
they searched, and eventually found a house 
in Trumpington, in the south of Cambridge,
which they could see had potential. However,
they knew they would have to modernise the
property and spend quite a lot on it. ‘We were
lucky enough to be cash buyers after selling

kitchen-diner and living room flow seamlessly
in and out of each other. Decking leading from
the living room into the garden encourages  
a year-round indoor/outdoor feel.
The Cockcrofts hit a problem when damp
was discovered in the corners of the rooms.
Ivy on exterior walls was partly to blame, but
mainly it was down to poor ventilation. So they
installed a dehumidifier on the staircase to
circulate air and remove moisture. Damp aside,
transforming the house was a smooth process
and once the builders had finished, Alicja
turned her attention to the décor.
‘I measured each room, then started to look
for interesting items,’ she says. ‘Although we
brought some things from our old home, my
feeling is that every house requires a fresh
approach, so we ended up selling anything that
wasn’t going to work and buying new.’
Alicja is an artist who has recently started
an interior design business, AZ Interiors. Her
vibrant paintings provide splashes of colour
and texture in the neutral scheme. Quirky
accessories, vintage lighting and one-off finds
add to the eclectic vibe.
The Cockcrofts now love their bright and airy
home, which they feel is in just the right spot.
‘We’re on the edge of the city and we look out
onto fields and grazing animals,’ says Alicja. ‘Our
windows are the biggest pictures of all.’

Kim and Chris Marshall have turned an abandoned farmhouse
and its ramshackle outbuildings into a coherent, contemporary idyll
Take the 60-SECOND TOUR

EXTREME
ransformations
THE PROPERTY
A detached, four-bedroom,
18th-century farmhouse and 
barn in Dartmoor, Devon,
converted into one house,
with a three-bedroom annexe 
in the former milking parlour.
WHO LIVES HERE 
Kim and Chris Marshall live here,
with their children Dora, 16, and 
Rufus, 15. Kim is a solicitor and
Chris works as an accountant.
WHAT THEY DID 
The Marshalls renovated the
farmhouse and barn, then 
linked the two with a glazed
extension. They also created 
a self-contained annexe.
WHAT IT COST
The couple paid £950,000 
for the farm in 2011 and 
spent around £750,000 on 
the property, which is now
worth more than £2.5 million.
⊳GROUND FLOOR
Off the main hall, there’s 
a kitchen with living area,
while a second hall leads
to a dining room and living
room. Another hall leads
to a bathroom, a pantry,
utility room and plant
room. The annexe has a
kitchen/living area, two
bedrooms and a bathroom

PROPERTY IDEAS  Converting farm buildings
W
hen Kim and Chris
Marshall first saw West
Yard Farm, set in 58
acres of pasture and
woodland in Dartmoor,
they had very different
reactions. ‘After house-hunting for three years
I immediately fell in love with the location, but
Kim couldn’t stop crying,’ says Chris. ‘It’s an
incredible place – bordered on two sides by the
National Park and extremely private – but Kim
hated the idea and needed to be persuaded.’
Chris found the property online and
was convinced that the farm could provide
a long-term home. Kim, however, was far more
practical about the reality of buying such
a run-down property, which included an
18th-century granite farmhouse and a collection
of tumbledown barns and farm buildings.
DRAWING UP IDEAS Unoccupied for years,
the house had been unsympathetically
renovated in the Forties and Seventies, with
The spacious steel-framed

...‘how our
architect
blended
traditional
and modern
ideas and
materials so
effortlessly’
most of its original features stripped out, 
but once Kim was on board, the couple were
determined to not only renovate the house, 
but to convert the outbuildings, too.
‘We engaged an architect who had fantastic
ideas, but the cost would have exceeded our
budget by more than four times, and made  
us start to doubt whether the project was 
even feasible,’ says Kim. ‘We then found local
architects Van Ellen + Sheryn (vanellensheryn.
com), who came up with a whole new design,
placing the kitchen at the heart of the house.’
Connecting the house and an adjacent barn
with a glazed box would provide a new kitchen
and living area with fantastic views. The barn
would be converted to create two bedrooms
and a bathroom upstairs, with a pantry, utility
room, bathroom and plant room downstairs. 
To one side of the house, a detached milking
parlour has also been extended and converted
into a self-contained three-bedroom annexe with
a dramatic green oak and glass structure,

forming a glazed gable end, and the roof has
been clad with patinated zinc.
It was tricky to get planning permission for
the barn, as it was thought bats were living there
and bat shelters are legally protected. But in the
end the plans were approved, and the architects
suggested builder Goulden and Sons (goulden
andsons.co.uk) for the project. Work began in
February 2012 and finished in the summer of
2013. ‘We came in 17% under budget, thanks  
to our builders’ diligence,’ says Chris. 
The farmhouse was stripped back to  
bare stone walls and required rewiring and
replumbing. A new timber-and-steel roof was
built, and the windows were replaced. The
steel-framed glass-box extension, which has
become the hub of the house, now has sliding
glass walls with a fantastic view. In the milking
parlour, double-glazed units were inserted  
into the green oak frame. 
ECOFRIENDLY BUILD As well as blending
traditional and contemporary design, the
property is also very environmentally sound.  
A ground-source heat pump in the plant room
provides underfloor heating, supplemented  
by four wood burners. Solar panels produce
electricity and hot water, there are LED lights
and low-energy appliances throughout, and the
water on the farm comes from a natural spring. 
‘It’s great that the house is so self-sufficient – our
fuel bills are considerably reduced,’ says Chris. 
When it came to decorating, Kim was keen to
make use of natural materials throughout her 
‘We found local architects who came up with a new
design, placing the kitchen at the heart of the house’
new home but wasn’t sure where to start, so 
she signed up for an interior-design course. 
‘We had used up most of our budget on the
renovation and I didn’t want to make expensive
mistakes,’ she explains. ‘Putting together a
colour palette I could use throughout saved me
such a lot of time, and I enjoyed choosing and
adding a focus colour in each room.’
The couple are delighted with the way their
home looks. ‘The mixture of new and old is so
appealing,’ says Chris. ‘Now we have more than
enough space and such beautiful views, too.’
The original brick fireplace
was discovered under 
layers of concrete. Lovingly
restored, it now adds
character to the dining area

RENOVATION
KNOW-HOW
The original stone walls of the
farmhouse and outbuildings were
repointed using traditional lime
mortar. Inside, the walls were  
left unsealed for a natural finish.
■ If you have a property with stone
walls, you’ll need to take extra care to
ensure they’re safe and weather-tight.
You can find a surveyor to assess
them for you at the Royal Institute of
Chartered Surveyors (ricsfirms.com).
■ Damp penetration can prove to be
a problem with stone walls, and repair
and repointing with suitable materials
is vital. Because they need to breathe 
IN DETAIL STONE WALLS
Renovate stone walls, like the Marshallsdid
White units and walls
with oak beams and
raw brickwork create
a dramatic yet simple
look in the annexe
and let absorbed water evaporate,
stone walls should not be patched
up with sand and cement, which
will prevent this happening.
■ Building new homes using
stone is becoming increasingly
popular at the moment and,
although natural stone is an
expensive material to buy and lay,
the cost will usually be reflected
in the value of the finished house.
Cast or reconstituted stone offers
a cost-effective alternative, but it
can lack the authentic appeal and
subtle variation of the real thing.

Converting farm buildings  PROPERTY IDEAS 
A black roof and window

a smart, contemporary edge
D
reams of living in Dartmoor with
their sons, Connor, seven, and Fizzy,
five, led Siobhan and Mat Hayles to
take on a historic farm that needed
a lot of work. Living in London, they’d come to
Dartmoor camping and loved it, so in 2011 they
took the plunge and bought the farm, complete
with a derelict barn and a resident peacock that
they named Peeky. ‘Even though the buildings
were crumbling ruins, we completely fell in
love with them,’ says Siobhan.
Once used for livestock, the single-storey
barn had a rusty, leaky corrugated-iron roof,
and a stream ran behind it, so everything was
mouldy and wet inside. The building was partly
buried in the slope of the hillside, too, but
Siobhan and Mat still had high hopes for it and
planned to turn it into a holiday let. ‘We wanted
to combine the feel of a traditional Dartmoor
farm building with the luxury of a designer
hotel suite,’ explains Mat.
Although the farm isn’t listed, it’s within
Dartmoor National Park, so there were lots of
planning constraints, including the materials
that could be used in restoring it. Siobhan 
and Mat chose local architectural practice

Woodford Architecture + Interiors (01364
654888; woodfordarchitecture.com) to draw
up a conversion that would retain the exterior,
including the corrugated metal roof.
UP FOR A CHALLENGE The building work
began in November 2014 and took seven
months. ‘We employed a local builder, who
was amazing, and Mat helped with the labour,’
explains Siobhan. ‘They stripped out the barn,
and the granite walls were rebuilt with stone
from the farm. We tanked the back of the
building and put in new land drains, too.’
Internally, the stone walls were repointed
with traditional lime mortar, durable limestone
flooring was laid over underfloor heating and
hand-made timber windows and glazed doors
were installed. The building now contains a
bedroom with a roll-top bath, a shower room, a
kitchen-diner, a snug and a seating area. The
cart door has been replaced by a 4m stretch of
glass doors. Finally, Siobhan chose colours
inspired by Peeky the peacock’s tail to decorate
and furnish the barn.
Having cost £200,000 to convert, the barn
can’t be sold separately, but the couple do rent
it out via uniquehomestays.com. ‘It was hard
work,’ says Siobhan. ‘But it’s been worth it.’

T
he original kitchen in Alice and
Will Parker’s East Sussex home
was dark and cold, with a galley
layout. ‘It led to a side return
with a high garden wall that
blocked light and created a dull
view from the kitchen sink,’ says Alice. ‘Space
was tight, too; we could just squeeze in a dining
table, but it partially blocked the patio doors,
limiting the light and access to the garden.’
The couple decided to add an extension at
the back of the house to create a large family
kitchen. Alice drew inspiration from magazines,
blogs, restaurant décor and shop fittings before
honing her ideas so they would work together.
Building work started nine months after the
family moved in. ‘We were without a kitchen for
months and the house got incredibly dusty,
but it was good to be here to make decisions
and answer questions from the builders to 
keep the project moving,’ says Alice.
Some decisions, like the flooring, were
simple. ‘I’ve always loved reclaimed parquet
because it looks like it’s got a story to tell –
new wood just doesn’t have the same look,’
says Alice. ‘It also works for the floor to be 
light in here, as the units are dark.’
Sourcing the units wasn’t so easy. ‘I must
have had 45 samples of doors, but none of
them were right,’ says Alice. ‘Luckily, I found
Ditchling Kitchens, which was able to make
exactly what I’d pictured. The new kitchen
has transformed the way we live. It works so
well that we hardly use the rest of the house.’

How we did it
The kitchen was part of
a big renovation project spanning
10 months. We replaced the main bathroom,
and replastered and redecorated the whole
house at the same time. The building work
involved fitting steel beams and extending

A
fter 25 years with the same
kitchen, Kate and Paul
Simpson knew a change was
long overdue. ‘It was looking
very tired,’ says Kate. ‘We’d
knocked the dining room and
kitchen together 20 years ago, so it was open
plan, but we’d painted it blue, which felt dark.’
With their two boys no longer living at home
full time, Kate and Paul decided on a redesign
that better reflected how they now live. ‘There
was a peninsular sticking out that obscured the
best asset in the room – the glorious window
and view – that had to change,’ says Kate.
‘Plus we wanted to lighten everything up.’
The Simpsons chose high-gloss, off-white
units. ‘We thought white would be too clinical
and wouldn’t suit the rest of the house,’ says
Kate. The room has lovely original alcoves,
which the couple wanted to show off, so they
opted for built-in shelves in one and a
freestanding unit in the other. ‘We had to have
a galley design, as it’s a long, thin room, but
we started the units further back to let the
view take centre stage,’ says Kate. ‘Now it’s the
ideal spot to sit and look out to the garden.’

stainless-steel moulded worktops, which
were specially made for us. The hob and
sink had to be built in, so the measurements 
were key. We paid one price for the entire
job, so we didn’t have to manage various
tradesmen. The build took around three
months, but we had to wait a further
three months for the bespoke elements.

aving lived in their Cheshire
home for nearly 20 years,
Hilary and Philip Beattie
were itching to give their
kitchen an overhaul. ‘It was
tired and we felt it was high 
time for a new design,’ explains Hilary.
Not only did the couple replace the dated
kitchen furniture, but they also decided to
knock down an internal wall between the
existing kitchen and dining room, and add
an extension across the rear of the house,
complete with bifold doors to the garden.
The couple chose smart linear cabinetry
in warm dark oak and cool matt white from
local ﬁrm Trukitchen. ‘We were looking for
something clean, modern and simple, and  
we felt that this combination had just the
right amount of interest and contrast without
appearing fussy,’ explains Hilary.
A large island is the main cooking area,
complete with hob, with an easy turn to reach
the ovens. ‘I enjoy being able to face out into
the room when I’m cooking, so I can be part
of what’s going on,’ says Hilary. The breakfast
bar bridged off the island is a family favourite.
‘The bar seats the four of us comfortably for
meals, and it’s more sociable than sitting in  
a row at the island,’ she says.
‘The ﬁnishing touch for the kitchen was a
roll of ridiculously expensive wallpaper,’ says
Hilary. ‘I wanted to go bold, and I fell in love
with a bright orange design. It adds zing and
finishes off the room perfectly.’

laire and Paul Redwood wanted
to update the main bathroom
in their home in Esher, Surrey,
when they moved in seven years
ago, but they held off, as they
couldn’t justify the expense. ‘We
knew we would replace it eventually,’ says Claire.
As it happened, being patient worked out for
the best, because the couple’s plans changed.
They decided to turn a spare bedroom next to
the bathroom into a dressing room. ‘I wanted  
to have an en suite that linked with the
dressing room, so it made sense to swap our
old en suite with the main bathroom,’ says Claire.
When it came to decorating the new en suite,
Claire longed for a calm, tranquil haven that
emulated the look and feel of a boutique-hotel
bathroom. A designer bath was top of her wish
list, so she was delighted to find a discounted 
limestone tub online. ‘I found a local showroom
that had the same bath on display, so I was able
to see it, touch it and lie in it to work out if it
was what I really wanted,’ she says.
Claire has added interest to the room with
a mix of tiles, all in complementary neutrals.
She chose a running-bond tile pattern for the
walls in the walk-in shower, mosaics for the
shower floor and large-format floor tiles for
the rest of the room. ‘I spent ages looking for
a range of tiles that comes in different sizes
and compatible colours, so I knew the tiles
would work together,’ she says.
Brown mosaics used as a splashback behind
the vanity unit and in the storage recesses
beside the bath add a stylish finishing touch.
‘The en suite is tucked away, so I go up there
after a busy day to unwind,’ says Claire. ‘It’s  
a peaceful space and a real treat to have.’

How we did it
We decided to use a building
firm, Eclipse Property Solutions,
that was recommended by my sister. When
the builders found that the bath was too
heavy and slippery to lift up the stairs, they
hired a crane and brought it in through the
window. The floor needed reinforcing, so
they set the bath on a plinth with LEDs
along the bottom. The delivery of our tiles
was delayed because of snow, and then we
discovered the order was wrong and we were
short. I had some family coming to stay at
Christmas, but the fitters came back at the
weekend to finish it off, just in time. The
building work cost around £5,000.

THE PROPERTY
A four-bedroom, Georgian,
terraced house in northwest
London, bought in 1998.
WHO LIVES HERE
Caryn and Simon Coyle live
here, with their 16-year old
twins, Erin and Daniel.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple gained space by
removing a hot-water cylinder
and replaced the tired suite with
contemporary fittings and storage.
THE LOOK
Sleek Scandi style, with wooden
panelling and matt white tiles.
LESSONS LEARNED
Expect the unexpected – we
didn’t discover that the walls
needed work until the old
tiles had been removed. This
involved extra costs and some
added days to the project.
TURN OVER TO FIND OUT HOW
Caryn and Simon created their new bathroom
BEFORE
Perfect balance
The Coyles ensured their
spacious en suite looks in
proportion by rejigging
the layout and fitting a
large shower, twin basins
and a dressing table

Bespoke design
Caryn came up with
the concept for the
twin-basin vanity unit
and had it made to
measure. Its wall-hung
design shows off the
striking herringbone
tiling on the floor

T
he original en-suite bathroom
in Caryn Coyle’s northwest
London home was a badly
planned space that required a
drastic rethink. ‘It was a huge
room, but the tiny bath looked
silly, as did the pedestal basin, and the shower
stuck out right by the doorway,’ she says.
While researching online, Caryn discovered
architectural practice McLaren Excell, which
she took on to plan the project. She was keen
for the en suite to complement the pared-back
décor in the main bedroom and key to this was 
the choice of storage. ‘I wanted a Scandinavian
look for the units,’ she says. ‘We had them
custom-made using moisture-resistant MDF.’
Caryn then chose the twin basin to top
the units and bought a large walk-in shower.
Sourcing the ﬂoor tiles, however, wasn’t as
straightforward a job. ‘It took lots of trips
to local tile shops before I found one to
produce the herringbone pattern on the ﬂoor.’
Despite her love of colour, Caryn is glad she
went for the neutral scheme. ‘Having no colour
accents can really work well in a bathroom, as
it allows every detail to stand out,’ she says. ➺

‘It’s small but so
perfectly formed’
You can steal space from unlikely places to make
a bathroom bigger, as the O’Briens discovered
H
élène and Gary O’Brien’s
original bathroom suite
was dated, with tired blue
and white ﬂoor tiles and
ﬁxtures that were 15 years
old. ‘Water had ﬂooded
through to our dining room ceiling three
times, so it was deﬁnitely ready for a reﬁt,’ says
Hélène. The style of the new room was inspired
by the couple’s recently renovated Shaker-
style kitchen. ‘I wanted a similar look for
the bathroom,’ explains Hélène. ‘I opted for
freestanding units to create a relaxed feel,
and having a roll-top bath has always been
a dream of mine, so that was a must-have, too.’
Tall trees outside make the bathroom rather
dark, so the O’Briens went for a light scheme.
‘I contrasted the pale walls with a darker bath
to get a more contemporary look,’ says Hélène.
When it came to deciding on the layout, the
couple went all-out to maximise space. They
swapped the location of the loo and basin to
get rid of some space-hogging pipework, then
moved a radiator and knocked through into the
airing cupboard to create space for a shower.
They even gained enough room for a cupboard.
Hélène is so pleased with the ﬁnished look.
‘We really relax in here,’ she says. ‘You can’t beat
a soak in a beautiful room after a stressful day.’
Take the 60-SECOND TOUR
THE PROPERTY
A five-bedroom, detached, Nineties
house in Horsham, Sussex.
WHO LIVES HERE
Hélène and Gary O’Brien live
here with their daughter, Eva, five.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple knocked through into
an airing cupboard to create space
for a shower enclosure. New floor
tiles were fitted, the pipework was
updated and the suite was replaced.
THE LOOK
A mix of contemporary and vintage
elements in calming tones.
LESSONS LEARNED
I printed out detailed information
about all the products we had
chosen – it made it easier to
answer the builder’s questions.
THE LAYOUT The loo is to the left of the
door, next to the basin which sits under
the window. Opposite is a shower
enclosure, and a bath sits at the far end

When was the last time you replaced
your bed? Research by the Sleep
Council shows that after 10 years,
your bed and mattress may have
deteriorated by as much as 70% due
to wear and tear and the accumulation
of sweat, skin cells and dust mites. 
It’s difficult to get deep, restful sleep
on an uncomfortable bed. As Jessica
Alexander from The Sleep Council
says: ‘Just one bad night’s sleep affects
our mood, concentration and alertness.’
So, invest in better sleep and you
invest in your health and quality of life.
If anyone’s got the formula for a comfy
bed right, it’s hotels – it is their job  
to sell a great night’s sleep, after all.
Premier Inn, Marriott and Hilton take
such pride in the quality and comfort
of their beds, that their guests can buy
the whole kit and caboodle – mattress,
linen and all – online, after their stay.
Here’s what the experts say about the
basic building blocks of a comfortable
bed, and how to get them right…
BUY THE BEST BEDSTEAD
The Sleep Council has this advice:
 Don’t just consider how a bed looks,
but check whether it gives the right
amount of support (especially if you 
or your partner suffer from back pain),
and that it’s easy to get in and out of.
 Go for as large a bed as you can
afford and have space for. Ergonomic
studies have shown that couples sleep
better in a wider-than-standard 
double bed as they can turn without
disturbing their partner – so it’s worth
going for a king or super-king size.
 Always try before you buy and 
test a bed for comfort together if it’s 
for two. Simply try each one on your

short list in your favourite sleeping
position for 10 minutes to appreciate
the differences between them
and feel which one suits you best.
Don’t buy a bed and mattress
separately – they have to work together.
Sizes are not standard and even if they
have the same description (such as
‘king size’) they may not have the same
measurements – especially if they are
not from the same manufacturer. 
KNOW YOUR MATTRESSES Try
the Sleep Council’s MOT (Mattress
Obsolescence Test) at sleepcouncil.
org.uk – if you answer ‘yes’ to three
or more of the questions, you’re not
getting the best night’s sleep; if you
answer ‘yes’ to five or more, it’s
time for a new mattress. If you need
to replace yours, here are some
need-to-knows before you shop:
Sprung mattresses are made from
wire coils; pocket sprung means the
individual springs are encased in
fabric. Non-sprung mattresses include
foam, gel or wadding-filled designs.
Innovations in the sprung mattress
market include The Smith, a
collaboration between furniture
retailer Swoon Editions, and boutique-
hotel booking service Mr & Mrs Smith.
The Smith mattress combines layers
of Hampshire wool, cotton, silk and
cashmere for comfort and breathability,
as well as a double layer of pocket
springs for support, all encased
in fine Egyptian cotton. It’s priced 
from £499 at Swoon Editions.
New advances in the non-sprung
market include the Arbor (from £1,275)
at Heal’s, which has a core of soft
fibres, padding and Talahay latex,
made from sap harvested from
sustainable rubber forests. This
material is hypoallergenic, anti-
bacterial and anti-dust, plus it’s
breathable and contours to your body
to provide ergonomic spine support.
Also new to the market are three
mattresses that arrive packed in a box.
The One, £349, from Made.com; Eve,
also from £349, evemattress.co.uk and
Leesa, from £390, leesa.co.uk. All
promise long trial periods of 100
nights, or 101 in the case of The One,
with a money-back guarantee if you’re
not satisfied. All three have a three-
layer construction: The One is made
up of a Cool Blue memory foam top, a 
breathable Laygel latex middle and
a high-density Reflex foam base for
‘cloud-like’ comfort; the Leesa has
a cooling top layer, a memory foam
middle layer and a supportive base
layer; the Eve has a memory foam
top, a high-resilience comfort layer 
and a high-density base layer.
Don’t be seduced into buying an
unnecessary mattress topper – they
are great for boosting the comfort
and support of an old mattress, but
shouldn’t be necessary if you’ve just
bought the right mattress. 
TEST THE MATTRESS PROPERLY
The only way to find the right type
of mattress for you is to try them out.
Faye Janes, assistant bed buyer for
John Lewis explains: ‘When you’re
testing a memory-foam mattress, you
should lie on it for as long as possible
so it has time to adjust to your body
temperature. It’s important to lie in
the position you naturally sleep in. If
you share a bed, your partner should
always be with you when trying a new
mattress to make sure it offers the
right support for you both. Some
mattresses offer split tensions, with
one side firmer than the other – a great
option if there’s a big difference in
weight, or you and your partner have
different preferences over firmness.’
Look for the National Bed
Federation’s ‘NBF Approved’ large tick
logo, which means that the product
you’re buying meets flammability
regulations and is clean and hygienic.
UNDERSTAND DUVETS’

filling’s ability to trap air and provide
thermal insulation. The lower the
tog, the cooler you will feel under the
duvet, so for summer opt for a lower
tog (between 3-4.5), in autumn a
medium one (7.5-10) and choose a
higher one for winter (12-13.5). The
most popular rating is 10.5 as it can be
used for all seasons, but make sure you
choose a good-quality duvet to ensure
it’s breathable and that you won’t
overheat in the warmer months.’
BE FILLING-SAVVY Thicker
doesn’t necessarily mean warmer.
‘Down – the fluffy feathers birds
use to incubate their eggs – is the
finest natural insulator around, as
it provides warmth without weight,
and retains heat very well,’ says Sally.
‘Synthetic fillings are good alternatives
to down or feathers for allergy
sufferers, and there are plenty
of high–quality options, such as
hollowfibre and microfibre, which
can offer a luxurious experience.’

CHOOSE A PILLOW THAT
MATCHES HOW YOU SLEEP
One size doesn’t fit all when it
comes to pillows, explains Sally:
‘The right pillow will help keep your
spine aligned and relieve aches and
pains. If you sleep on your front, opt
for a soft pillow to prevent a backwards
stretch in your neck. If you sleep on
your side, you’ll need a firm pillow,
with lots of filling to support your head
and reduce pressure on your shoulders.
Back sleepers are better off with a
medium pillow to support the head
and create a gentle curve in the neck.’
TAKE NOTE OF THREAD COUNT
Molly Freshwater, co-founder of
Secret Linen Store, shares her
expertise on sheets and bed linen:
‘Thread count is the number of
threads per square inch of fabric.
The higher the count, the denser and
more durable the fabric. However, you
can’t judge quality by thread count
alone, as some manufacturers cheat
by twisting together thinner, lower
quality yarns to bump up the thread 
count. In reality, a 600 thread count 
is about the highest you can go.’
Molly recommends buying sheets
with a thread count of 200-600.
‘Anything below 200 will feel thin
and won’t last,’ she says. ‘Your sheets
have to take more wear and tear than
your duvet cover, so they’re worth
spending more on.’
INVEST IN EGYPTIAN
COTTON FOR DURABILITY
Molly explains why Egyptian cotton 
is superior to standard cotton:
‘Egyptian cotton has established
a reputation for being the best for use
in bedding because it’s a good-quality
yarn with long fibres, which make it
hard-wearing, yet soft to the touch.’
‘Certified Egyptian cotton is grown
in Egypt, so it comes with a higher
price tag, thanks to expensive growing,
harvesting and shipping costs, but if
you want luxury and durability, it’s
worth paying for. Be sure the label
says 100% or pure Egyptian cotton,
otherwise it may contain only a small
percentage of the good stuff.’

You don’t need much space, skill, time or money to 
grow delicious spuds, so give it a go this spring
Try something new...
Q
I CAN BUY POTATOES – WHY
SHOULD I GROW THEM?
Once you’ve discovered the intense
flavour of home-grown spuds and
experienced the deep satisfaction
of digging up your own crop, you’ll
never look back. Unlike some other
vegetables, potatoes are very low
maintenance once you’ve planted
them. You don’t need acres of space,
either – if you don’t have a garden, you
can grow them in a compact gro-sack
(H45cm x diameter 30cm), £7.95 for
three, Marshalls, on a patio or balcony.
In fact, a pile of tyres, a large bucket 
or an old plastic compost sack
(with drainage holes) will do the job
adequately – you simply need a sturdy
container that’s at least 30cm in
diameter and 30cm deep. 
Q
WHAT TYPE OF POTATOES
SHOULD I GROW?
You can’t plant supermarket potatoes 
– you need to buy special seed
potatoes from a garden centre or an
online supplier. Each seed potato tuber
you plant will send out lots of side
shoots, which all swell and become
individual potatoes. Ideally, plant
at least three different types of seed
potato: first early crop, second early
crop and main crop, so you have
potatoes throughout the whole 
summer season. Try ‘Winston’ (a first
early), which works well boiled or
steamed. ‘Charlotte’ (a second early) 
is a flavour-packed, pale-yellow
variety that’s ideal steamed and used
in salads, while ‘Desiree’ (a main crop)
is a versatile potato with red skin and
delicious waxy yellow flesh. 
Q
WHEN SHOULD I PLANT  
MY POTATOES?
Work back from when you want to
harvest them. First earlies can be
planted from late February to late
May and crop in about 10 weeks;
plant second earlies from March to
late May – they will crop after around
13 weeks; main crop potatoes can
be planted from March to mid May,
and will crop about 20 weeks later.
Q
HOW DO I PLANT THEM?
About four to six weeks before
planting, you should place your seed
potato tubers on trays (cardboard egg
boxes are ideal) and leave them to
‘chit’, or grow little side shoots, indoors
somewhere light and cool but free of
frost. If you’re going to grow your
potatoes in a vegetable patch, they’ll
need a sunny spot. Start by digging
a 10cm-deep trench, then plant your
seed potatoes with the shoots pointing
upwards, about 30cm apart, in rows  
FEATURE ELLIE TENNANT PHOTOGRAPH LOUPE IMAGES/POLLY WREFORD
that are around 60cm apart. When
the shoots reach 20cm, mound up the
soil around them, leaving just a few
centimetres showing. Repeat this three
weeks later. If you’re growing in potato
bags or containers, fill to just below
the top with good-quality compost
and place a single chitted potato
tuber in the compost, shoots pointing
upwards, at a depth of 12cm. Keep 
your plants well watered.
Q
HOW DO I HARVEST THEM?
When the leaves of your plants
begin to turn yellow and die back, your
potatoes are ready to harvest. Use a
garden fork to lift the earth beneath
the plant gently, then sieve the soil
with your hands or a potato scoop to
gather the potatoes, taking care not
to damage them. Brush off any loose
soil and, for main crop potatoes, leave
them to dry in the sun for a few hours
before storing them in a dark paper
or hessian sack somewhere cool and
dry, until you need them. New potatoes
(first and second earlies) can be
rinsed clean and taken straight from
plot to pot for cooking.
Q
ANY TIPS FOR COOKING?
New potatoes are delicious
steamed with a few sprigs of fresh
mint. Remove the mint before serving
and stir through a knob of butter
and a handful of chopped chives or
parsley. For perfect mashed potatoes,
mash with salted butter, milk and
freshly ground black pepper, then
stir through 1tsp wholegrain mustard
and a handful of grated Cheddar.

●Mark out your area and weed
thoroughly, removing grass
and other culprits. Rake the
soil level and simply spread
a specialist meadow seed mix
over the surface. Firm in using
the head of the rake or your
feet and wait for the rain.
●After you’ve been delighted
with the annuals, ‘graduate’ 
to a stunning perennial

white, pink and red blooms,
camellias provide stunning
colour during the darkest winter
days through to early spring.
Native to the woodlands and
mountains of East and South
Asia, these are tough beauties
that are happy in cooler climes.
HOW TO GROW Best planted in
spring or autumn, camellias do best
in moist, well-drained, acidic soil with
a pH between 5.5 and 6.5. The plant
will tell you if the soil is too alkaline,
as the leaves will turn yellow. Help
counteract this with a thick mulch
of composted pine bark. Plant in
a sheltered position out of the wind
and in partial shade, especially if it’s
a pale-flowering variety. Add plenty
of grit to the planting hole to improve
drainage and water well.
Help bees by
planting wild
flowers, such as
poppies and false
bishop’s weed

WHY WE LOVE IT… Let’s start with
dash cams, which record incidents

an insurance claim. Some insurers

I’d also add a sat nav to your list –

smartphones loaded with map apps,
but they’re a good way to go if mobile
reception isn’t guaranteed or you want
to avoid data charges. ‘You’ll also get a
dedicated screen and a better speaker
for voice commands,’ says Tom
Brown, TomTom’s UK vice president.
An in-car charger is vital if you’re

You can wash and dry more at once
Traditionally, if you wanted to dry a
reasonable-sized wash, you’d have to take
out some of the load first so it would have
space to tumble. But this machine lets you
wash and dry 6kg at a time – that’s around
30 T-shirts. It also has a 9kg wash capacity.
2
Clothes won’t shrink. A common fear
of using a washer-dryer is that it will
shrivel up your woollens, but there’s no
need to fret over cashmere cardis placed
in this machine. It’s one of the first models
to be awarded Woolmark’s Blue label,
signifying that it can clean and dry hand-
wash-only woollens safely. Other fabrics 
are protected, too, as the machine
automatically adjusts spin speed and
temperature according to fabric type.
3
It’s reliable Another complaint of
washer-dryers is their tendency to break
down, but this one has reduced vibration
and a brushless motor, so is less likely
to develop a fault. And it’s quieter, too.
4
An outfit can be ready in an hour
The nonstop ‘dry-to-dry’ programme
will wash, then dry up to 6kg of laundry
in 60 minutes. If all the outfit needs is a
quick refresh, there’s an even speedier
steam programme, which will remove
odours and wrinkles in 15 minutes.

You might have heard of induction,
but what do you know about it?
These are the pros and cons…
Girl About Tech explains…
WHAT IS IT? You’re probably
familiar with standard ceramic hobs,
which have heating elements
underneath the glass surface that
warm up and transfer heat to the zones
above. Well, induction hobs might look
the same but they work very differently
– instead of an element, they have
a circular coil under each zone that
generates a magnetic field. Only
when you place a ferrous-metal pan
onto the surface and effectively
‘complete the circuit’ will heat induce
through the coil and into the pan itself.
WHY DO I NEED IT? Like the
Kardashians, induction hobs have been
around for ages but a lot of people still
don’t understand their appeal. So what
justifies forking out possibly hundreds
of pounds more for one – a hob, that is,
not a Kim or a Khloe – if you’re happy
with your gas burners or ceramic
zones? Well, in a word – lots. I’ve listed
five good reasons (see right) why you
should consider switching to induction
but for me, personally, it’s all about
control and precision (see point 1).
If you’re still in doubt, you only have
to look at the list of top chefs who have
ripped out the gas burners in their pro
kitchens and replaced them with
induction hobs – it includes Michel
Roux Jnr (at Le Gavroche), Nick Nairn
(at his Aberdeen cookery school) and
Dan Doherty (at Duck & Waffle). Dan
finds working with induction makes
for a much cooler, more comfortable
kitchen, so much so that he even
admitted to me that he’s thinking
about getting his chefs thicker uniforms!
‘It’s difficult to burn food (or yourself)
with an induction hob,’ says Dan. ‘And
if you’re low on space, you can use the
cooktop for prep.’ The man has clearly
seen my kitchen mid-dinner party! 
Induction hobs

CLEANING
IS SO EASY
There are no pan supports
or burners to negotiate,
just a flat surface to wipe
with a damp cloth. And
spills are less likely to
get burnt on, as the hob
doesn’t get hot. Now and
then you could clean it
with soapy water (avoid
harsh chemicals) and buff
it up with a paper towel.
YOU’RE IN
CONTROL
Gas may be responsive, but
induction is even more so. It
reacts instantly when you change the
heat level and you can go down to very
low settings that gas hobs often can’t
hit. This makes it easier to, say, keep
water in a bain-marie or hot milk at a
simmer. Likewise, you can also hit high
temperatures for exact amounts of time,
which makes searing meat a doddle.

INDUCTION
HOBS 
YOU MIGHT
NEED TO BUY
NEW PANS
Not all cookware works with an
induction hob. Your pans need to have  
a ferrous-metal base, such as 18/0
stainless-steel or cast-iron, which makes
a circuit with the magnetic coil in the
element, otherwise the pan won’t heat
up. To test pans, hold a magnet to their
bottoms. If it sticks, you’re in business.
The base should also be ‘perfectly ﬂat,
and not dimpled, domed or ridged,’ says
Jennifer Spragg, senior brand manager
at Whirlpool. ‘This guarantees even heat
distribution and the best performance.’ If your
pans are pure copper or aluminium, you’ll need
new ones. Some manufacturers throw in a free set 
of compatible pans if you buy one of their hobs;
others ofer ‘adaptor’ discs that sit under your pans, like
Whirlpool’s Wpro Induction Hob Adapter Plate, from £35. 
IT’S SAFE
While no appliance is childproof
and I’d never recommend you leave
little ones near a hob unattended,
induction cooktops are safer than
most. Because only the pan gets hot, not
the hob, it is harder to burn yourself –
albeit there’s a small amount of heat
when the pan is removed (a residual-
heat indicator light warns you of this).
Most induction hobs have child
locks, so kids and pets can’t turn the
heat on, up or of accidentally. And
look out for pan detection sensors that
distinguish between a pot and other
metal items, so the hob won’t heat up
a teaspoon left on it. One ﬁnal feature
is a pause button. If you have to deal with
a ringing phone or crying child, press it and
any active zones will come down to the lowest
heat level, so they won’t boil over. Press it again
and the zones go back to their previous settings.
4
IT’S REALLY,
REALLY FAST
Boiling two pints of water
takes around 11 minutes
on a standard ceramic hob
and nine minutes on gas,
whereas an induction hob
with a decent boost
function can do the job in
little over a minute. Think
of the time you’ll save when
making rice or pasta, and the
reduction in your energy bills!
Best of both

PELLING/WADDESDON MANOR/THE NATIONAL TRUST
1. CHATSWORTH HOUSE
Derbyshire (chatsworth.org)
Sir William Cavendish bought
Chatsworth for a mere £600 in 1549
and, after being passed down through
16 generations, it’s now the family
home of the Duke and Duchess of
Derbyshire. It’s the stately home
everyone’s heard of, thanks to the
BBC behind-the-scenes documentary
and its star role as Mr Darcy’s
Pemberley in the TV adaptation of
Pride & Prejudice (yes, the one with
Colin Firth in a wet shirt…). You’ll
need a whole day to do it justice: with
its art collection including ancient
Egyptian sculpture and masterpieces
by Rembrandt, Renoir and Lucian
Freud, its beautifully landscaped
grounds complete with 300-year-
old cascade, plus its working farm,
there’s loads to see. Don’t miss the
brilliant farm shop or the boutique
shops specialising in interiors,
gardening and children’s toys.
Nearby: In the heart of the Peak
District, Chatsworth is surrounded
by walking and cycling trails for
outdoorsy types (peakdistrict.gov.uk).
2. BLENHEIM PALACE
Oxfordshire (blenheimpalace.com)
Did you spot it in the latest Bond film,
Spectre? Blenheim starred as the
Roman palazzo – a role it could pull
off thanks to its magnificent baroque-
style architecture by Vanbrugh and
Hawksmoor. Allegedly inspired by
Versailles, it signalled the start of
English Romanticism. The palace
was built as a gift from Queen Anne
to the First Duke of Marlborough
for his victory in the 1704 Battle of
Blenheim, but is best known as the
birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill
(there’s a special exhibition there to 
commemorate 50 years since his
death). For a sophisticated day trip,
indulge in a smart Sunday lunch in
the Orangery, or for a fun family
outing, hop on the miniature train to
the hedge maze and butterfly garden.
Nearby: Go sightseeing in Oxford –
visit the colleges, take a leisurely punt
along the river or try a city tour on
two wheels (oxfordbicycletours.com).
3. OSBORNE HOUSE Isle of
Wight (english-heritage.org.uk)
Imagine being queen for a day
at the once-upon-a-time summer
home of Victoria and Albert. The
Italian-inspired house reflects
the more relaxed side of the usually
austere Queen Victoria, and while
it might be palatial, Osborne also
embodies all the fun and charm of the
English seaside. The Queen regularly
bathed at the private beach – it’s
worth the walk down there to see her
personal bathing machine, visit the
ice-cream parlour and enjoy a slice
of Victorian life playing skittles and
quoits, or watching a Punch & Judy
show. In the gardens you’ll find the
poshest Wendy house ever – Swiss
Cottage – designed between 1853
and 1854 by Albert for his children.
Nearby: Head to Blackgang Chine to
see swashbuckling pirates, cowboys
and dinosaurs, as well as rides and
games (blackgangchine.com).
4. WADDESDON MANOR
Buckinghamshire
(waddesdon.org.uk)
With its medieval maiden’s hat-style
turrets, Waddesdon looks like a
fairy-tale castle. The vision of a banker,
Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild, it
took 14 years to complete and hosted
the crème de la crème of guests within
royal, cultural and political circles
at its glittering house parties. The
bachelor’s wing, with its billiard room,
could have been a ‘man cave’ for the
19th century. Priceless paintings,
porcelain and objets (as you’d expect
from a family of fine-art collectors)
litter the flamboyant décor. Don’t
miss the wine cellar, housing 100,000
bottles and charting 150 years of
Rothschild wine-making history,
and look out for the Rothschild
mynah bird in the rococo-style aviary.
Nearby: Stay at the boutique Five
Arrows hotel and pick up some
designer bargains at Bicester
Shopping Village on the way
home (bicestervillage.com).
5. HATFIELD HOUSE
Hertfordshire (hatfield-house.co.uk)
Elizabeth I learned she would become
queen in the Old Palace (which you
can still visit on the estate) and when
Hatfield was built by the first Earl
of Salisbury, Robert Cecil, in 1611,
the breathtaking marble hall was
decorated with the famous Rainbow
portrait, depicting the new queen
as the bringer of peace. The house  
is a great example of Jacobean
architecture – look out for the
elaborate stone, marble and mosaic
chimneypieces and the beautifully
carved Grand Staircase, complete
with special gates designed to stop
the household dogs getting into the
state rooms. Don’t miss the blinging
gold-covered ceiling in the Long
Gallery or Hatfield Park Farm,
where there’s a mini version of
the house in the kids’ play area
and rare-breed animals to see.
Nearby: Visit the stunning gardens at
specialist horticultural college, Capel
Manor (capelmanorgardens.co.uk).
