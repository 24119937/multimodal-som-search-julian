HOME COMMUNITY
My to-do list
for December
The things I’ll be planning, doing 
and shopping for this month
W
ith Christmas on the way, I’ll
be getting prepared, creating
a beautiful mess with the
kids and planning a get-together.
ENJOYING THE RUN-UP As with any
holiday, I enjoy the planning of Christmas
as much as the event itself. I’ll gladly
sacriﬁce my precious weekend sofa time
to throw myself into a whirl of organising.
Anything that requires lists generally
makes me happy and Christmas inspires
a lot of them! I’ll make sure the house is
sparkling, dealing with dusty skirting and
corner cobwebs that I don’t mind living
with the rest of the year, just because I
know Ma Richmond notices these things.
I’ll add whisky to my Ocado order with
Pa Richmond in mind and put a reminder
in my phone to buy both the Radio
Times and TV Times, even though they
both cover all the channels these days,
because my sister and I still go through
them circling what we want to watch.
GETTING HANDS-ON I’m not a
hardcore crafter, but I do enjoy making
things at Christmas, especially if the
littlest Richmonds are involved. From
wonky mince pies to paper chains and
home-made cards, ’tis the season when
the quality of the results is utterly
outweighed by the truth of ‘it’s the
thought that counts’. The children treat 
me like another kid on these
occasions, reminding me
that ‘we have to share, Auntie
Nessa’ if I hog the glue stick
and giving me disapproving
looks if I pretend to sneeze 
out green glitter. Now
they’re old enough to play
with cool stuff, I’ve been
looking at gifts with my own
secret agenda. I hope Santa
brings the Frozen Sparkling
Ice Castle Lego set this year!
HOSTING A WRAP PARTY No, not the
celebrity kind, but the sort where you
get folks to bring all the gifts they need
to wrap and get down to it in a mass
frenzy of paper, gold ribbon, sticky tape
and snacks. Christmas jumpers, or at
the very least comedy reindeer antlers,
are obligatory. As are crooners on the
stereo and an abundance of Quality
Street. This way, I hope, I’ll dodge
the usual last-minute wrap panic on
Christmas Eve, falling in to bed just
before the littlest Richmonds wake us
all up with shouts of ‘He’s been!!!!!’.

December SHOPPING IDEAS
Precious minerals
Designers are being inspired
by the Earth’s natural gems  
THE NEXT BIG THING
THE STORY SO FAR Traditional white
marble has been a key trend for some time,
but it’s coloured marble and the swirling
layers of malachite, onyx and agate that
keep cropping up in high-end design for
furniture, accessories and wallcoverings.
WHERE WE’VE SEEN IT Ahead of the
trend was Fornasetti at Cole & Son, which
launched its Malachite wallpaper in 2007.
In 2013, Patricia Urquiola commemorated
the Emilia earthquake with a collection of
furniture and accessories made from layers
of coloured marble and onyx unearthed by
the disaster. The Albatre wallpaper design
by Casamance followed in 2014, succeeded
by the swirling marble-effect Makrana
wallpaper from Harlequin this year.
LATEST RELEASES Jonathan Adler has
added malachite-effect accessories to his
quirky collection. Tom Faulkner’s Siena
side table and Gubi’s Gamfraseti series
of side and coffee tables come in green,
black and brown marble. The high street
has already caught on, so look out for agate
coasters at Marks & Spencer, black and
green marble-effect ceramics at H&M,
and hints of emerald and onyx-effect agate
in John Lewis’ Indulgence collection.

aving produced 15 million
mugs after the ﬁrst ones
left the production line in
1985, Emma Bridgewater
is incredibly proud to be still running
her successful business producing
unique pottery and homeware. Set
up after Emma tried unsuccessfully
to ﬁnd a birthday present for her
mother, the company now produces
some of the most recognisable pottery
designs on the market.
‘I was looking for a special cup and
saucer for my mum’s dresser, but just
couldn’t ﬁnd anything I liked,’ explains
Emma. ‘I realised that there was a gap
in the market for pottery that was both
beautiful and practical.’
Today, the company is run by
Emma and her husband Matthew Rice,
a painter, designer and author. Emma
is responsible for the brand’s signature
spongeware patterns, while Matthew
works on its collections, such as the
popular Black Toast range.
Most of the production work is
still done by hand at the factory in
Staffordshire, and each piece is
slightly different. The company, one
of the largest employers in Stoke-on-
Trent, has recently expanded into
glass, tins, picnicware and home
fragrances, as well as a wallpaper and
fabric collection for Sanderson.
THE WOMAN BEHIND THE LOOK
Emma grew up in Oxford and just
outside Cambridge, spending time
with both her parents, who divorced
when she was a child. She and

Matthew now live near Oxford and
have four children. ‘I am equally  
at home with grass or paving stones
underfoot,’ she says. ‘I went to Oxford
High School, which I completely loved,
and I’m proud to be a governor there
now. I then read English Literature  
at the University of London – the
perfect training for a life in the
manufacturing industry,’ she laughs.
In the early Eighties, Emma worked

Wonderful, which made woolly
jumpers and other clothing. ‘It was
a fantastic company and a great
experience,’ she says. ‘A year spent
visiting women knitting in their
houses was fascinating, but it probably
made me more determined than ever
to have a factory of my own one day.’
CAREER PATH
Although Emma never trained as
a designer, she had experimented
with making sponge-
painted ceramics,  
so when it came to 
creating the perfect  
cup and saucer for  
her mother, it seemed
natural to design it 
herself. That led to 
working from her 
bedroom in a ﬂat  
in southwest London, where she kept
a kiln and designed and made mugs,
jugs and dishes. ‘It was clear early on
that people liked my ideas, perhaps
because I’ve never been a slavish
follower of fashion,’ she says. ‘I still
ﬁnd it exciting that we make things
that people want to buy and have
in their homes.’
Christmas is an important time
for Emma, both personally and for
the company. ‘Christmas is a time
for feasting and for making a table
look wonderfully rich and full, so it’s
a great time for buying pottery,’ she
says. ‘This year, we have the most
delicious turkey platter with a large
multicoloured turkey walking across
it, made using eight separate sponge
colours. I think it’s one of our nicest
patterns to date.’
Emma will be spending Christmas
at home with the family this year. It’s
an environment that reﬂects her love
of the simple things in life and her
approach to design. ‘My
house is fairly messy and
informal, with dogs, cats
and chickens, and
a continuous parade
of children passing
through,’ she explains.
‘The kitchen is in the
middle of our house,
and it’s where we love
to come together as a family. Matthew
is an extraordinary and energetic
gardener. He produces cut ﬂowers and
vegetables on a regular basis – we can
never keep up with his home-grown
beans and courgettes.’
THE EMMA BRIDGEWATER
PHILOSOPHY
‘Do it once and don’t change it; only
use things you love; only buy things
you really want; and always have
a picture of Elvis in the kitchen.’

GET TO KNOW
HER SIGNATURE
STYLE From the
very beginning,
Emma knew she
wanted to make
pottery that could be used and
enjoyed every day. ‘Matthew and
I only design things we love and
would like to own ourselves,’ she
says. ‘Things that are beautiful to
look at but also a pleasure to use,
such as a lovely mug that feels just
right in your hand, or a bowl with
a playful message that makes you
smile every time you eat from it.’
A lot of ideas for the Emma
Bridgewater collections come
from appreciating the simple
pleasures of everyday life, such as
bringing people together around
the kitchen table. ‘Our Marmalade
pattern was inspired by a
family tradition of stocking the

cupboards with home-made

made our deep pasta serving

one big enough to feed a hungry
family of six,’ says Emma.
Growing up in a busy, bustling
household as the eldest of eight
children has been a big influence
on Emma’s life and her mother’s
kitchen dresser, which was laden
with family treasures and
mismatched mugs, plates and
bowls, undoubtedly provided her
with inspiration. ‘When I was a
child, our house and especially
our kitchen was always more
fun than other people’s,’ she
says. ‘It felt more welcoming
and generous, and I have always
wanted to reproduce my mother’s
trademark warmth and relaxed
hospitality for my own family 
and friends to enjoy.’

S
arah and Paul Norton’s Hampshire
cottage is chocolate-box perfect
now, but it took a lot of hard work
to make it happen. ‘It’s one of
the oldest houses in the village,’
says Sarah. ‘We could see it had
potential as a family home, with a spacious
kitchen and dining area, a good-sized living
room and a beautiful garden, but we were in for
a few surprises when it came to redecorating.’
The cottage is located in a rural hamlet near
Andover. It had been a weekend bolthole for
its former owner, and had suffered a series of
botched repair jobs over the years, the worst
of which was a layer of cement render that
caused damp in the 17th-century walls. ‘The
building’s original horsehair cob was so
damp, much of it just fell away,’ says Sarah.
The couple began the restoration process
by employing a specialist builder to render
the property inside and out with horsehair
and lime. New hand-blown single-glazing was
made to comply with the cottage’s Grade-II ➺
3 Kitchen-diner
‘We had to design our
kitchen round the ancient
beams,’ says Sarah.

listed status. Other major work included laying
oak ﬂooring throughout the ground ﬂoor and
installing a new bathroom inspired by a smart
en suite Sarah and Paul had seen at a b&b.
The couple also replaced the dated kitchen.
‘All the cabinets had to be made by hand
because none of the walls are even,’ says Sarah,
who added personality to the space by hanging
a ﬂoral wallpaper behind glass splashbacks.
Putting right the old decorating mistakes ate
into the couple’s budget, but it enabled interior
designer Sarah to use her creative skills to the
full. By decorating rooms in soft neutral shades
and layering texture to add warmth, she has
given her home a comfortable, contemporary
look, while never straying too far away from
its period roots. ‘My secret is to produce
moodboards,’ she says. ‘I spend time tearing
images out of magazines and looking at
paint colours and fabrics. It helps you to
plan your look and to keep to your budget.’
Customisation is another one of Sarah’s
decorating tricks – she has altered many pieces
➺
6 Utility room
Sarah has given the
practical utility area  
a pretty look with a
country-style storage
bench and a matching
wall shelf unit above it

to create something unique. ‘I chose an oak
cabinet for the bathroom, but I didn’t like  
its handles, so I swapped them for hand-crafted
ones from a specialist maker,’ she says. ‘It’s  
not a complicated thing to do, but it can make
all the difference when you’re trying to bring  
a sense of individuality to your home.’ 
A neutral colour scheme throughout the
house sets a calm mood. ‘I know from other
projects I’ve done that the best way to create
harmony is to use a similar palette of colours
and to ensure there are no harsh distinctions
between rooms,’ says Sarah. ‘A harmonious
feeling is important in a house like this with so
many different levels and nooks and crannies.’
Sarah also works as a ﬂorist, so as Christmas
approaches, she is busy creating garlands  
of fresh and silk ﬂowers, and sumptuous 
festive displays. In her own home, every room
is adorned with pretty candle arrangements
and hand-made decorations. 
The advantage of the cottage’s relaxed 
colour palette and simple style means it can

be easily transformed to celebrate the festive
season. Sarah sets the mood using wreaths,
garlands and baubles, which she decorates
by hand. ‘I paint them so they’re all unique
and, after producing them all year round, I love
ﬁnally seeing them up at Christmas,’ she says.
Sarah’s seasonal display in the dining-room
window has become something of a village
institution. ‘I’m known locally for having a
stall of decorations at the Christmas fair, so
people will often come and have a peek in
the window to see what’s going to be on offer,’

When Sarah has completed her ﬁnal

on Christmas morning, we join the rest of the
village for a drink in the pub before eating
lunch and ﬁnally unwrapping our presents.’

S
ue and Jonathan Eley hadn’t
planned on buying a second home,
but when Jonathan was browsing
through the Sunday property
supplements one day in 2012, he
spotted an unusual house and
showed it to his wife. ‘Let’s buy it,’ she said
jokingly. They were intrigued and not long
after, on a dark winter’s day, they drove down to
Rye Harbour in East Sussex to take a look at it.
Steeped in history, the Watch House on the
River Rother overlooks a salt marsh and nature
reserve. It was built in around 1835 by The
Admiralty as a customs house to collect tax
from ships entering the port of Rye, and as a
lookout for coastguards spotting smugglers.
The couple loved it instantly. ‘We were like
kids at Christmas,’ says Jonathan. ‘I suppose
maybe subconsciously we were looking for
➺
a holiday home, even though we weren’t
registered with any agents. It was a bit of a
stretch, but we decided to put in an offer and,
if it wasn’t accepted, just say, “Oh well, it wasn’t
meant to be”.’ To the couple’s delight, the
vendor agreed and by March they were the
owners of a 200-year-old Grade-II-listed
property in need of considerable upgrading.
They started with the exterior and, with
Jonathan acting as project manager, working
closely with the planning ofﬁcer and local
craftsmen, they modiﬁed the chimney stack,
repaired the ﬂues, restored the brickwork and
replaced the roof. The house also needed a new
boiler and new plumbing, drains and electrics.
‘We had to repair all the things you don’t see
that cost a lot of money,’ says Jonathan.
The kitchen was rustic in style, with red
terracotta ﬂoor tiles, low ceilings and black

beams that made the room rather dark – it was
desperately in need of a brighter look. Local
carpenter and builder Paul Haver ﬁtted
kitchen units with oak worktops and laid new
ﬂoorboards. The couple kept a range cooker,
but removed a large black cooker hood. Some
outdated mosaic splashbacks were replaced
with simple, white, metro-style tiles. ‘We
painted every surface white to help reﬂect
as much light as possible,’ says Sue.
A new wooden ﬂoor in the kitchen was
extended into the ground-ﬂoor bedroom, and
the shower room on the ground ﬂoor was
remodelled by moving a wall, turning it into
a small cloakroom. This helped enlarge the
hallway at the bottom of the stairs, freeing
up space for a large antique linen press.
Upstairs, in the living room, the couple
removed pine tongue-and-groove panelling

Laminate ﬂooring was ripped up to reveal
original boards, and the whole room was 
then painted white. The bathroom was also
revamped – the Eleys brought in Tollets, 
their local builders, for the work, and the 
walls were panelled with salvaged ﬂoorboards
and cladding to cover up ugly pipework.
As the house took shape, Sue and Jonathan
began looking for furniture. ‘We had a good
idea of what we wanted,’ says Sue. ‘The
furniture here is nothing like our furniture at
the house in London, which is quite colourful.’
They bought some new pieces, as well as
some eBay buys and some from local antiques
and junk shops. Jonathan made a few inventive
items of furniture that cost next to nothing,
such as the platform for their bed and the
coffee table in the living room, which he

built using old timber pallets. ‘They cost just
a ﬁver each from a building site,’ he says.
‘I painted them white to match the décor, 
then added metal castors to the base.’
The couple still have more plans for the
house. A modern conservatory at the side of
the property is going to be replaced, but Listed
Planning Consent will be needed. Sue is more
than halfway through an ambitious redesign of
the garden – so far she has turned an old pond
into a seating area. On starry nights, the family
likes to wrap up in blankets and gather round
the ﬁre pit to star gaze and take in the sea air. 
The Eleys love coming to their peaceful
and quiet seaside haven, and at Christmas the
atmosphere here is very traditional. ‘I am just
a big kid at heart and I love Christmas,’ says
Jonathan. ‘I like to wow Sue and the kids –
I come down on my own and put up the tree
and all the decorations before they get here.
Then we do the big Christmas dinner with a
turkey bought from a local farm and we have
friends to stay. Spending Christmas together 
is important to us, wherever we are.’ IH

housetohome.co.uk/idealhomemagazine  DECEMBER 2015
W
hen Jennifer and
James Wilson decided
to view a three-storey
town house in a new
development near their
home in Edinburgh,
it was purely on a whim. ‘We were living in
a large Georgian apartment at the time,
which we loved, but the minute we saw this
development, we fell for it,’ says Jennifer. ‘Our
apartment needed crucial repairs and we knew
we’d have to undertake the works or move,
so we decided it was time to take the plunge.’
However, the couple didn’t want to buy the
house they’d viewed. Instead, they wanted one
of the four-storey properties, which came with
a roof terrace, but none of those were for sale.
Undeterred, Jennifer wrote to the owners
of all the four-storey houses with a proposition
to buy, and was thrilled when three of them
➺
3 Kitchen
The high-gloss taupe 
units suit the couple’s
understated look
perfectly. They have
teamed them with  
soft grey furniture

the Raffello in cream, from
£62 for a W600mm door,

try the Cornell, £79.99
each, Atlantic Shopping
responded positively. ‘It just shows that it’s a
very worthwhile exercise if you want a speciﬁc
property in a particular street,’ she says.
The house Jennifer and James ﬁnally chose
was an end-of-terrace one, which had been
extended by the previous owners to create a
garden room, and with its additional windows
in the rear wall, was by far the lightest and 
most spacious of the three houses. 
It was a blank canvas of magnolia walls and
cream carpets as the previous owners, who  
had visited only at weekends, had never had the
chance to put their own stamp on the house.
Jennifer and James set about doing this as
soon as they moved in. ‘We know what we want
when it comes to interiors and would never live
in a house for a year or so before decorating,’
says Jennifer. ‘We got going immediately.’
Consequently, the look was pulled together
swiftly, with the couple speedily injecting

style and character into the house with chic
decorative choices. ‘We relied on texture and
pattern, rather than colour, to shape the look,’
says Jennifer. ‘I love monochrome ﬁnishes 
and ﬁnd details, such as textured, rough-luxe
wallpapers, are a great way to add interest.’
There’s a subtle East-meets-West theme
throughout the house, too – a result of Jennifer
and James’s love of travel. ‘We wanted to create
a soothing refuge, hence the exotic Zen touches
that bring a sense of serenity,’ says Jennifer.
As with many contemporary builds, the
living room is on the ﬁrst ﬂoor. It’s a peaceful
sanctuary, decorated in pale tones and sensual
fabrics. ‘We retreat here to relax in the evenings
and watch TV,’ says Jennifer.
The ground ﬂoor houses a guest bedroom
and the kitchen, plus a dining room that has 
➺
dark purple walls with shimmering silver-grey
carpet, and has curtains and blinds in a deep
shade of aubergine. Upstairs, there are two
bedrooms with en-suite bathrooms and  
a balcony, and the top ﬂoor comprises the main
bedroom and en suite, and the roof terrace.
The couple particularly enjoy their home’s
hassle-free outdoor spaces. Two south-facing
balconies, a roof terrace and a patio are all 
low maintenance and provide lovely views of
Edinburgh. ‘With little need to do any actual
gardening, they’re ideal for me,’ says Jennifer.
‘We’ve got some topiary on the roof terrace 
and a few palms in planters, but that’s the
extent of our gardening expertise.’
The couple have appreciated being able 
to create a new home without messy and
time-consuming structural work. ‘It’s all

Jennifer. ‘We could concentrate on things like
the quality of the ﬁnishes, the solid hardwood
doors, the bathrooms and the ﬁtted cupboards,
all of which are beautifully made. It has been 
a pleasure to personalise the house.’
Jennifer’s online business Urban Cuckoo
(urbancuckoo.co.uk) specialises in the quirky,
contemporary style that she and James love.
At Christmas they have their pick of seasonal
decorations, which look great against the
luxurious wallpapers and carefully selected
fabrics in the house. ‘Everything in our home
has a subtle, muted ﬁnish that we can liven up
at Christmas with frosted, glittery decorations
for festive sparkle,’ says Jennifer.
Christmas Day is busy in the Wilson house,
with visits from both sides of their extended
family, lots of seasonal good cheer and piles of
presents to unwrap. ‘We have everyone around
for a party on the day,’ says Jennifer. ‘We do get
a bit carried away, but it’s nice to celebrate.’

A
t Christmas time, Lesley
Pennington’s home glows
with a welcoming spirit.
Lesley is a Canadian who,
20 years ago, moved from
the United States to be with
her Swedish husband Fredrik, and she loves
the Scandinavian way of doing things. ‘On
Christmas Eve, my family comes over for a
traditional Swedish smörgåsbord of herring,
meatballs and salads, and to open presents,’
says Lesley. ‘Later on in the holiday, I’ll cook
up a Canadian feast – turkey, stufﬁng, mash
– which my two stepsons, Björn and Emil,
and our daughter, Zoe, enjoy just as much.
‘Sweden is very dark in the winter, especially
in November and December, so Christmas is

something you can focus on,’ says Lesley.
‘Swedes celebrate for the whole month of
December – it could be eating gingerbread
cookies with friends, baking cakes at the
weekends or lighting Advent candles. It
takes the attention away from the darkness.’
Lesley trained as a graphic designer, but
10 years ago she chanelled her love of interiors
into home textiles. She founded Bemz (bemz.
com/en-gb), an online store that supplies loose
covers for Ikea sofas to customers around the
world. After two decades immersed in the
simplicity of Swedish home style, and with her
evident love of beautiful design, it’s no surprise
that her home is so easy on the eye. ‘I have a
very personal approach to décor – I like to mix 
up antiques with mid-century pieces and

modern Scandinavian design,’ she says. ‘I love
using interesting textiles, too – redecorating
with cushions, curtains, rugs and throws is
a great way to change things without having
to invest in new furniture.’
For Lesley and Fredrik, coming across their
detached, early 20th-century house in the
paper one Saturday three years ago was a lucky
ﬁnd. ‘We’d been looking to move for a while,’
explains Lesley. ‘Our children were growing
up and we needed a different kind of home to
accommodate our family. As I ﬂicked through
the property pages, I spotted this 1926 house
in a seaside suburb of Stockholm, a 20-minute
train journey from the city. It wasn’t an area
that we’d been considering, but I liked the look
of it immediately and went to view it that day.’
When she arrived, the house was crowded
with other eager homebuyers. The appeal was
➺
‘I love using interesting textiles –
redecorating with cushions, curtains,
rugs and throws is a great way to change
things without having to invest
in new furniture’
clear – the owners had restored their home to a
very high standard and little needed doing, not
even painting. Moving in would simply be a
matter of furnishing the rooms. ‘They had paid
a lot of attention to the period details, such as
the bleached pinewood ﬂoors and the rustic
wood cladding on the walls,’ says Lesley. ‘The
house had been loved and cared for, it wasn’t
sterile, and I put in an offer there and then.’
The family moved into their new home three
months later, in December 2012, and over
the next year, Lesley created a look that is
elegant, yet homely. ‘I wanted to do something
as creative and personal as the previous owners
had, to create a cocoon for my family,’ she
says. She took her furnishing inspiration
from the exterior of the house and its seaside
surroundings – the red tiles of the roof, the grey
of the wood cladding, the green of the trees,

For similar chairs, try the

£333 each, Bridgman
and the blue-grey of the rocky shoreline and
the sea beyond. ‘I wanted to bring the colours
of nature and of the building inside the house,
which is why there are threads of red and 
green in every room,’ she says.
Lesley and Fredrik brought a few items from
their previous home – their favourite Arco
ﬂoor lamp for the living room, a couple of
large paintings and various Eames chairs – but
Lesley sought out new things, too. ‘I didn’t want
to force our old furniture into the new house,
so I recycled quite a lot of it via the website
blocket.se, and found new things to buy from
there and other websites, such as the online
auction house Bukowski Auktioner,’ she says. 
The couple’s favourite room is the cosy
snug on the ﬁrst ﬂoor, which has lovely views
into the tree canopy and to the sea beyond.
It also has an outdoor terrace, for enjoying the
long summer nights. ‘This is where we relax
as a family, read books, watch TV and chat,’
says Lesley. Everyday affordable designs, such
as an Ikea sofa, are mixed with more special
pieces, such as a pair of original Bruno
Mathsson T102 chairs from the Thirties.
‘Beautiful design makes me happy,’ says
Lesley – spoken like a true Scandinavian.
‘I have a very personal
approach to décor – I like
to mix up antiques with
mid-century pieces’

1
Choose your base colour Whether
it’s ﬂooring or a wall, the base colour
will be the largest area of colour in your
room, so place a generous sample of it
onto your board. Including carpet samples
will help you think about texture, too.
2
Add an accent tone A dramatic
contrast or an accent just a few tones
away from your base colour? Use your
moodboard to play with options and
layer it with swatches of fabric, scraps
of wallpaper and paint colour charts.
3
Find the right accessories
These will really set the tone in your
room – go for ones that share an accent
colour and stick to a single theme. Don’t
mix styles, or your ﬁnished scheme will
look messy rather than effortlessly eclectic.

1
THE 70-20-10 RULE For a
balanced scheme, keep 70% of
the elements (say, walls and ﬂoors)
as one colour, then add 20% in
a second colour (fabrics) and
10% in an accent (accessories).
2
THE PATTERN RULE When
mixing patterns, use large with 
medium or medium with small,
never large with small. Pick prints
that share a colour in common.
3
THE PAINTED BOX RULE
The look of paint changes
according to the time of day and
the light in a room. Paint the inside
of a large box with a tester to create
a miniature ‘room’ and see how the
colour changes within a 3D space.
AND FINALLY… Always add
a surprise. A focal point – whether
it’s a feature wall or a piece of art
– is the short cut to a ‘wow’ room.

C
reating the right mood
for a relaxing, classic
Christmas can be easy
if you use the right ingredients.
To conjure up a festive scheme
that’s soothing yet still looks
magical, keep brightly coloured
baubles, bold wrapping paper and
kitsch ornaments packed away
and stick to a simpler style.
CHOOSE A COLOUR Use a
couple of shades for decorations,
giftwrap and ribbons. Muted and
matt tones will bring a subtle
elegance – try old gold with
chocolate or pewter and dusky rose.
PICK SIMPLE SHAPES This isn’t
the look for tons of tinsel, clusters
of shiny baubles or Santa pictures.
Instead, include subtle country
motifs, such as hearts and stars.
GO NATURAL Nothing beats
the evocative smell of pine trees
and eucalyptus, so make the most
of nature’s bounty and include
a real tree, fresh foliage and
mistletoe in your decorating.

WHY WE LOVE THEM  
Inject light and warmth into
your decorating scheme with
the glitz and glamour of
metallic wallpaper and fabrics.
There’s a huge selection  
to choose from, including
traditional gold and silver
designs, and the latest bronze,
copper and rose-gold ﬁnishes.
WHERE TO USE THEM 
Traditional damasks in metallic
colourways create a dramatic
focal point in a living or dining
room, while metallic stripes,
geometrics and ﬂorals look
stunning in a bedroom or hall.
HOW TO USE THEM Due to
their reﬂective nature, metallic
wallpapers are an ideal choice
in smaller rooms as they will 
make the space seem larger, but
go for a plain gilded design or
one which has a more intricate
pattern so that it’s not
overwhelming. Reserve big,
bold patterns for larger rooms
and statement feature walls.
Rich metallic fabrics will add an
opulent feel to curtains, while
an upholstered sofa or armchair
provides a luxurious touch.
HOW TO ACCESSORISE THEM 
Don’t be afraid to add metallic
accessories to the mix – gold,
silver, bronze and copper vases,
ornaments and tableware will
all enhance the glitz. Be sure  
to include a variety of lamps,
candelabras and lanterns, too, 
as these will bounce light
around the room even more.

fresh, vibrant shades, including bright
orange and lime, and coral and aqua.

No other shade evokes the celebratory mood

Use woollen and felt textiles in this bold colour
to bring a welcoming atmosphere to a cool
palette of taupe and grey. Add plenty of natural

From disused water tower…
Russell and Jannette Harris converted and extended a Grade-II listed
P
ure impulse led Russell
and Jannette Harris
to become owners
of a derelict water tower,
a much-loved local
landmark in the pretty
Cheshire village of Lymm. The couple
had lived in the village for several
years with their children, James and
Sophie, and would often pass the tower
– a crumbling, 130-year-old landmark
straight out of a fairytale. Redundant
for 30 years, its sole purpose now was
to serve as a platform for a number of
mobile-phone antennae.
Russell would regularly walk his dog
along the footpath by the side of the
AFTER

Transformations
BEFORE
tower, and when it came onto the open
market, he impulsively put in a bid and
bought the stone structure. Suddenly,
he and Jannette found themselves the
owners of a Grade-II-listed building,
and had to decide exactly what to  
do with their new acquisition. ‘What
began as a whim turned into our own
personal Everest,’ admits Russell when
he describes the ambitious project 
they took on. ‘There were times when
we thought we might never move in.’
MAKING PLANS Intent on creating
an inspirational family home within
the tower, the couple soon realised 
that it would be necessary to build  
a modern extension. Over a period  
of five years, they battled with planners
and local opposition, saw several
architects come and go, and almost
lost heart. However, a chance meeting 
with Barry Harvey of Redrow Homes
proved a turning point. He introduced
Russell and Jannette to Ellis Williams
Architects (01928 752200; ewa.co.uk),
and Julian Baker from the practice
came up with drawings that focused 
on blending contemporary design 
with the building’s traditional features.
Today, the finished two-storey
extension has a sleek curved exterior
finished in white render, with large
panels of glazing and a distinctive
overhanging roof. Inside, a series of

THE PROPERTY
A five-bedroom, five-storey
converted 1870s stone water
tower in Lymm, Cheshire.
WHO LIVES HERE
Russell and Jannette
Harris, with their children,
James, 25, and Sophie, 20.
Russell is a TV presenter/
producer and Jannette is
a production co-ordinator.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple restored the listed
tower and built a two-storey
wraparound modern extension.
WHAT IT COST
The Harrises paid £138,000
for the tower in 1997 and have
spent more than £750,000
restoring and extending the
building, which is now worth
more than £2 million.
▼A penthouse
is located
on the upper
floors of the
water tower
to hi-tech modern home
outward-facing living areas occupy the
ground floor, with bedrooms above.
CHALLENGING PROCESS ‘The tower
was built in 1870 and was sponsored
by the local landed gentry, which is
why it is so beautiful,’ says Jannette.  
‘It was the classic romantic Rapunzel
tower, but it was also in desperate need
of restoration.’ A detailed report by a
structural engineer found the existing
water tank to be expanding due to
corrosion, which had caused some
cracking in the stonework. Also, the
turret at the top of the spiral stairs had
been damaged by movement of the
original flagpole. All this called for  
a number of specialist companies to  
be brought in and led Russell to give
up work and take on the demanding
role of project manager, overseeing
the 60 companies involved in the
restoration and build process.
An unsightly selection of mobile
phone antennae on the roof of the old
tower meant that the couple were
entitled to rental income from various
telecom operators – all very useful
when faced with such a huge and
costly building project – but the
problem of what to do with the ugly
masts remained. The architect’s clever
solution was to conceal them by
adding another storey to the existing
stone turret and to recycle the heat
Victorian water tower into a stunning contemporary property

regulations and HETAS (hetas.co.uk)
requirements, and will usually contain
the insulated flue required for installation. 
■A non-combustible hearth, at least
12mm thick, is required for suspended
wood burners, and should extend
300mm all around the fire front.
IN DETAIL SUSPENDED FIRES
Install a striking fireplace, like Russell and Janette did
they produce back into the building’s 
underfloor heating system.
The main tower was sandblasted and
the original water tank removed, with
new windows punched into the thick
stonework. Huge steel frames weighing
around 25 tons were then hoisted into
place to support the concrete floors, and
argon-filled double-glazed units were
fitted before foundations could be laid for
the new extension of rendered blockwork. 
Problems occurred at almost every
stage of the project, costs spiralled and
the family watched dispiritedly as recently
applied render washed off the walls in the
rain, setting them back a week. However,
after eight long years, the work is finally 
complete. ‘Since taking on this project,
we’ve become passionate about modern
architecture and wanted the interior to be
as simple and uncluttered as possible,’
says Jannette. ‘We chose a seamless white
resin floor for the main living spaces and
added colour with lighting. The house has
a tremendous utilitarian look to it that
feels both contemporary and luxurious.’
‘We didn’t go out for dinner or on
holiday during the build, and we lived in
our work clothes,’ says Russell. ‘Sometimes
I wished we’d never bought the tower,
but the camaraderie of the team kept us
going, and the first time we soaked in
the roof-top hot tub with its 360˚ views,
we knew it had all been worthwhile.’

H
aving enjoyed many family holidays
in their Devon cottage, Clive and
Denise Wells knew they would need
to make changes to turn it into a
permanent home for their retirement. Situated
in a village near Kingsbridge, the house was
built in the 17th century, with just one room
downstairs and a small first floor. Extended
over the years, it now has four bedrooms and
a bathroom upstairs, with a kitchen, dining
room and living room on the ground floor.
The couple wanted a space where they could
sit and enjoy the garden, and they found the
solution in a magazine article. ‘We contacted
the company featured and Stuart Bayley from 
Living Space Architects (01392 270420;
livingspacearchitects.com) suggested building
a modern extension,’ says Denise. ‘We loved
his design.’ The curved single-storey extension
echoes the cottage’s patio with a sweeping
glazed wall and a radial flat roof clad in zinc.
CAREFUL PLANNING Stuart worked closely
with the conservation officer, and stressed that
the new extension would have little impact on
the older building. The timber windows were
retained and now look out into the extension,
while the original external glazed doors from
the old living room lead into the new space.
Planning permission was granted and the
Wells appointed builder John Oldrieve to do
the work, which began in September 2011
and was completed a year later. The patio was
lifted and foundations excavated for the curved
steel and glass structure, which stands on a
partially suspended floor slab and opens onto
the new terrace through faceted bifold doors.
The couple paid £624,000 for the property
in 2003 and spent £150,000 on the extension.
The cottage is now valued at £900,000.
‘Building the garden room has transformed
our lives,’ says Denise. ‘We keep the doors open
in summer and it’s perfect for entertaining.
Now everyone wants to spend time in our new
extension because not many people have such
fabulous views from their own sofa.’ 
Denise and Clive Wells brought their period cottage

with a separate tap
providing instant boiling
water. ‘I use this all the
time during the day to fill
saucepans and to make
hot drinks,’ says Jill
O
nce their three children
had ﬂown the nest, Jill and
Jim Robinson decided that
it was time to remodel and
refurbish their home to create
a modern layout that suited
their needs more. ‘The old kitchen was on the
north-facing side of the house and felt dingy,’
Jill explains. ‘The dark oak units we’d inherited
from the previous owners felt oppressive, and
we lacked worktop and storage space.’
The couple decided to add a small, glazed,
oak-framed, garden-room extension to the
existing living room, and to relocate the
kitchen to this new space on the south side
of the house. ‘The aim was to create the large, 
bright kitchen with living and dining
areas that we’d always wanted,’ says Jill.
A friend recommended a kitchen designer
to the couple. ‘When we visited the workshop,
we were impressed by the craftsmanship
and attention to detail,’ says Jill. ‘Initially,
we considered a contemporary design, but
as we’re both quite traditional, we decided
to opt for a Shaker-style kitchen with some
modern details instead.’
Now that the kitchen is complete, Jill is
relishing the thought of Christmas. ‘We have
a huge family gathering planned and I can’t
wait to have them all here,’ she says. ‘My new
kitchen is so welcoming, with space for us all 
to be together. It’s my dream come true.’

Zoned approach
The kitchen and living
areas are separated by
a partition, which hides
the cooking pots and
dishes from guests
sitting in the living area
A
nne-Lise Porter’s ﬁrst
impression of the home she
shares with husband Brian
wasn’t good. ‘When I saw the
kitchen, I was horriﬁed,’ she
says. ‘It was dingy and dirty,
with dark oak units and a lino ﬂoor. It had just
one window, so there wasn’t much light, either.’
However, she was able to see beyond the dated
décor and decided to replace the wall between
the kitchen and the living room with a partition
to create an open-plan room with zones.
The couple also extended to the side of the
house to enlarge the cooking area. ‘Being
Danish, I wanted a room with lots of light,’ says
Anne-Lise. ‘We also needed a family friendly 
space where we could keep an eye on our three
grandchildren when they are playing.’
Anne-Lise and Brian decided on a galley
layout for practicality. ‘The partition between
the kitchen and living area is high enough to
hide the cooking area when you’re sitting in 
the living space,’ says Anne-Lise.
White walls, units, worktops and ﬂooring
create a sleek look. The couple maximised
natural light by adding new windows on either
side of the hob and replacing an existing
window with a door opening out to the garden.
This Christmas, Anne-Lise is looking forward
to using her new kitchen. ‘It’s perfect,’ she says.
‘Brian and I can cook lunch, chat to our guests
and watch over our grandchildren all at once.’ ➺

THE PROPERTY
A five-bedroom, Arts and Crafts
house in Highgate, north London.
WHO LIVES HERE
Ruth and Paul Rodgers, with their
daughter, Georgie, 19. Ruth is a
journalist and Paul works in radio.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple gutted the existing
bathroom and had a room within
a room built, providing a seamless
box in which to create a wetroom.
THE LOOK
Luxurious, with moody colours
and rough and smooth textures.
LESSONS LEARNED
We should have fitted a hand
shower as well as an overhead
one. It would have made cleaning
the shower area a lot easier.
THE LAYOUT The basin is on the left
of the room, as is the shower, which is
opposite the window and is zoned off
from the basin by a glass screen
M
oving into their Arts
and Crafts house seven
years ago, Ruth and Paul
Rodgers had big plans for
the bathroom. ‘It had been
redesigned in the Eighties
and, apart from being very old-fashioned, the
woodwork was rotten, the shower was a dark,
dank cubicle and there was an impractical
three-quarter-size bath,’ says Ruth.
The couple decided to dispense with the bath
and, inspired by Italian design, made plans for
a luxurious wetroom instead. Ruth had seen the
ﬁnish she wanted for the walls in the lobby of
an advertising company. ‘Venetian polished
plaster has a marble-like lustre that looks like
crushed velvet and feels like glass,’ she says. ‘We
chose a deep chocolate brown, which shows off
the white basin and chrome ﬁttings beautifully.’
To complement the polished plaster, the ﬂoor
and shower walls were tiled with tumbled and
sealed travertine in a mix of large squares and
mosaics. ‘Although it’s very contemporary, it’s
got a rustic, Tuscan feel to it,’ says Ruth. ‘I feel
like I’m on holiday every time I take a shower.’

Neat solution
The loo is cleverly tucked
away in the corner of the
room so that it’s the last
thing you see when you
enter the en suite. Above
it, Sam had storage fitted
to keep clutter at bay 
F
or Sam and Peter Cunningham,
creating their new en-suite
bathroom was just a very small
part of the bigger job of working
on a self-build house – a project
that they began in 2011. ‘We
found a house with land to the side and decided
to build the property we wanted,’ says Sam.
The new house presented the couple with
the opportunity to create their ideal en-suite.
‘In our previous home, the bathroom was
cramped with a useless shower,’ explains Sam.
‘This time we wanted a modern room with  
a stylish bath and a powerful shower.’
Other must-haves included two basins and
a TV. ‘Having two basins stops us getting in 
each other’s way,’ says Sam. ‘As for the TV,
we love watching it when we have a bath.’
The couple came up with the basic design 
of the bathroom with the help of a local
designer. ‘We chose the colour scheme
ourselves – we wanted white and grey to match
the tiles we’d chosen,’ says Sam. ‘We added
accessories with touches of green, inspired
by some Orla Kiely bedding we had. Luckily,
we were able to get towels to match.’
The result is a smart space that looks like
it belongs in a boutique hotel. ‘This room is
a big success,’ says Sam. ‘We love the bath,
the freestanding tap and the storage units
above the loo. There’s not a thing we’d do
differently if we had to start all over again.’ ➺

Starting point
The monochrome Orla
Kiely print was the original
inspiration for the room’s
colour scheme. ‘The
shades we’ve used make
the en suite a calm place

Simple touches
Wall-hung taps and oval

ith Christmas just around 
the corner, the race is on  
to get our homes spruced 
up and ready for visitors. Perhaps your 
kitchen ﬂoor is an eyesore, you’d like to 
redo a downstairs loo or an en suite isn’t 
quite complete – whatever your plans,  
a visit to Topps Tiles will provide all the 
practical advice and inspiration you need 
to make improvements with conﬁdence.    
Try out different looks

sourced from around the world, Topps 
Tiles is sure to have the perfect choice for 
your project. Whether you’re sure of the 
style you want or don’t know where  
to start, it’s worth trying the Tile Visualiser 
facility in store or at toppstiles.co.uk. 
Simply pick a room that looks as close  
in layout to your own and you’ll be able  
to see how more than 1,300 styles of tile 
might look in situ. It’s a great way to get  
a feel for the scale and impact of different

tiles are unconvincing, check out the ones 
at Topps Tiles. New technology is making 
it possible to reproduce the texture and 
look of natural materials more realistically 
than ever. Both the Silvabirch range and 
Amazon-inspired Kapok porcelain tile, for

into your bathroom, where natural wood  
is not usually recommended.

Simple Solutions
MAKE AND GIVE PICKLES
Pickles are perfect for spicing
up leftovers, as part of a buffet or
just as a late-night snack snaffled
straight from the jar. Simple to
make, you can eat them straight
away, but they’re even tastier if left
to mature for a couple of weeks. 
SPEEDY PICKLING VINEGAR
Make this all-purpose pickling
liquid first, then use it as a base for
the other recipes. This makes 800ml
and the ingredients cost around £4.
1 Put the following ingredients in
a large stainless-steel pan: 500g
granulated sugar; 350ml cider
vinegar; 350ml white wine vinegar;
10g fresh root ginger (in chunks); 
zest of 1 large orange; 2 bay
leaves; 1tbsp whole allspice berries;
1 cinnamon stick, and 1tsp cloves.
2 Stir well with a wooden spoon until
all the sugar has dissolved.
3 Put on a high heat and simmer for
five minutes, stirring. Leave to cool.
4 Using a sieve, a jelly bag or muslin
in a funnel, strain out the spices. 
PICKLED ONION RINGS
Easier to serve – and eat – than
whole pickled onions, you can lift
the slices out of the jar with a fork 
Crunchy pickles are a store-cupboard essential at Christmas. Beautifully presented,
they make a thoughtful, inexpensive gift that doesn’t require skill in the kitchen

READY TO EAT
Olive wood pickle fork,
£2.65, Period Features
and add them to sandwiches. Makes
two 1ltr jars and costs around £5.
1 Slice 1kg peeled brown onions into
fine rings, put them in a sieve and
pour a kettleful of boiling water over
them to blanch them slightly. Rinse
them in cold water, give them a gentle
shake and leave to dry for 10 minutes.
2 Divide the onion rings between the
sterilised jars. Stir 1tbsp sea salt into
the pre-made pickling vinegar (left)
until dissolved, then pour the liquid
into the jars to 2cm below the rim. Seal
the jars and label them.
TIP Use red rather than brown onions
for a milder result, or throw in a few
dried red chillies for a spicier version.
PICKLED RED CABBAGE
Sweet and full of flavour, this is the
perfect partner for cold turkey and
winter stews. This recipe makes two
1ltr jars and costs around £5.
1 Sprinkle 1kg shredded red cabbage
with 2tbsp sea salt and leave it in
a colander over the sink for an hour
(the purplish-blue water it releases 
will stain, so take care).
2 Rinse the cabbage in cold water
and let it drip-dry for 10 minutes.
3 Pack the cabbage into sterilised
jars, using a spoon to compress it if 
necessary, then add the pickling
vinegar to within 2cm of the rim. 
Seal the jars and label them.
TIP Add a splash of red wine and
1tbsp yellow mustard seeds to the
cabbage for a flavour boost.
PICKLED PEARS
Delicious served with strong blue
cheese, such as Stilton. Makes one
1ltr jar and costs around £6.
1 Peel 1kg conference pears and cut
them into quarters, lengthways, then
remove the cores and stems.
2 Place the cut pears in a stainless-
steel saucepan and cover with the
pickling vinegar. Bring to the boil.
3 After 10 minutes’ cooking, remove
the pears using a slotted spoon and
place them in a sterilised jar.
4 Simmer the vinegar for 10 minutes
to reduce, then turn the heat off. Allow
the vinegar to cool slightly, then pour
it over the pears leaving a 2cm gap at
the top of the jar. Seal and label.
TIP Gently push a few star anise into
the jar, keeping them close to the sides
so they are visible through the glass.
Note...Once home-made pickles
have been opened, store them in the
fridge and eat them within one month.

December SEASONAL IDEAS
GET THE HOUSE
CHRISTMAS-READY
Your head might be full of gift lists and school concert dates, but it’s worth
checking off these basics so you enjoy a smooth-running yule
Use this check list in the run-up
to Christmas to get your home
shipshape and fully functional
before your first guests arrive.
KITCHEN/DINING ROOM
Do a stocktake of pots and pans to
check you have everything you need
to cook Christmas dinner.
Work out the size of roasting tin
you’ll need for the turkey, and that it
will all fit in the oven.
Audit crockery, cutlery and glasses.
Dig out and launder seasonal table 
linen, so that it’s ready to use.
Remove anything past its best from
the fridge and give the fridge a good
clean in preparation for refilling it.
Check that you have enough tinfoil
and clingfilm to cope with leftovers.
Stock up on basics, such as tea,
coffee, sugar, cereal and condiments
– the stuff that gets forgotten when
you’re focused on the turkey and pud. 
UTILITY ROOM
Restock your cleaning products,
not forgetting washing powder,
dishwasher tablets, rinse aid and salt.
Buy extra kitchen paper and loo roll.
Invest in an all-purpose stain
remover (try White Wonder cleaning
cream, £4.97, Lakeland) so you’ll be
ready for any spilling mishaps.

3 OF THE BEST TABLEWARE BASICS
Buy reserves of essentials, such
as light bulbs, candles, tealights,
batteries, pet food and cat litter.
HALLWAY/COAT CUPBOARD
Declutter and create a space for
guests’ coats, shoes and muddy boots.
Hunt down umbrellas and keep
them handy for guests when they’re
going to and from their cars.
LIVING ROOM
Give your living space a deep
clean before putting up Christmas
decorations and the tree – it’s harder
to dust once everything’s in place.
Put away ornaments to create
surface space for festive decorations
and for guests to put their drinks
down. Do you need more coasters?
Give upholstery and cushions
a good vacuum, getting rid of any 
pet hair and crumbs.
Where will everyone sit? Beg,
borrow or steal extra chairs, or use
pouffes and beanbags as a stopgap.
Make the room smell nice – wash
pet beds to get rid of that doggy
smell and burn some scented candles.
BATHROOM
Give the bathroom a thorough deep
clean and declutter shelves to make
space for holiday guests’ things.
Make sure you have enough towels
to go round for everyone, and get in
basic toiletries, such as toothbrushes
or shampoo, for guests who might
have forgotten to pack their own.
Check your first-aid kit and restock
the essentials – especially painkillers,
indigestion and diarrhoea remedies,
and treatments for colds and flu.
Almost every bathroom has a quirk,
like a stiff tap or a dodgy loo flush, so
get it fixed before your guests arrive.
Put a nightlight in the bathroom so
guests don’t have to switch a light on
to visit the loo in the dead of night.
GUEST BEDROOM
Tidy and clean the room, making
space for guests’ belongings.
Put hooks on the back of the door
to create extra hanging space.
Make the bed up before they arrive
and cover it to keep it dust-free.
Tell guests where to find pillows,
blankets and hot-water bottles.
Check all light bulbs are working.
Put out a travel hairdryer.
Supply a few books or magazines
in the room for bedtime reading.

soapy water for 10 minutes.
Wash gently, rinse and dry with
a soft microﬁbre cloth. Polish
the ﬁtting and bulb with a dry
microﬁbre cloth.

CLEAN CHANDELIERS
Place newspaper or towels

some kitchen towel into the
sockets to keep them dry. Dust
the ﬁtting, spray with glass
cleaner, then leave to drip-dry.

a soft, damp cloth. Wash glass
and plastic ones in warm,

You can leave the fancy stuff to bartenders, but here
are three basic cocktails everyone can learn to make
Try something new...
Want to treat your party guests to
a sophisticated tipple this holiday
season? Frankie Snobel, mixologist
and founder of cocktail company
Tipplesworth, shares step-by-step
instructions of how to make three
delicious classics. All of these 
recipes make one cocktail.
1
CLASSIC MARTINI
There are many claims on the
invention of James Bond’s favourite
tipple. Also referred to as a martinez
or a martine in the past, the name
‘martini’ stuck in the 20th century, and
this is what we all now call the classic
combination of gin and dry vermouth.
You will need
■Martini glass ■Ice ■50ml
Sipsmith London dry gin ■10ml
(2 barspoons/teaspoons) Blackdown
Silverbirch vermouth ■Strainer  
■2 olives ■Cocktail sticks
How to make it
1 Chill the glass with some ice. 2 Pour
the gin and vermouth into another
glass. Stir for 45 seconds to ensure it’s
mixed but not agitated. 3 Empty the
ice out of the martini glass and strain
the gin mixture into it. 4 Pierce a 
couple of olives with a cocktail stick
and pop into your martini.
2
MARGARITA
The true origin of this famous
citrus-flavoured cocktail with a kick
isn’t known, but it was definitely born
in Mexico and started showing up in
bars worldwide in the Thirties.
You will need
■Slice of lime, 25ml freshly squeezed
lime juice, plus a lime wedge ■Glass
tumbler ■Sea salt ■Ice ■50ml Ocho
Blanco tequila ■25ml Merlet triple sec
■5ml (1 barspoon/teaspoon) agave
syrup ■Cocktail shaker
How to make it
1 Using a slice of lime, wet the rim
of the glass, then roll its outer edge
into sea salt. Fill the glass with ice.
2 Pour the tequila, triple sec, lime juice
and syrup into a cocktail shaker, add
ice and shake well. 3 Strain the mixture
into your tumbler and garnish with 
the wedge of lime.
3
BLOODY MARY
It is said that, when vodka arrived
in Paris in the Twenties, Fernand ‘Pete’
Petiot, bartender at Harry’s New York  
FEATURE HEATHER YOUNG PHOTOGRAPH TIMEINCUKCONTENT.COM
Bar in the French capital, found
it rather tasteless, so he decided to
mix it with tinned tomato juice and
seasoning. According to various
sources the drink was named ‘Bloody
Mary’ either after Mary Tudor’s bloody
reign or after a barmaid at a notorious
Chicago saloon called Bucket of Blood.
You will need
■Slice of lemon and 12.5ml freshly
squeezed lemon juice ■Collins
glass (a tall tumbler) ■Celery salt
■Ice ■50ml Chase English potato
vodka ■100ml pressed tomato
juice ■4 dashes of Tabasco sauce
■4 dashes of Worcestershire sauce  
■Stick of celery
How to make it
1 Using the slice of lemon, wet the rim
of the glass, then roll the glass’s outer
edge in a dish of celery salt and fill
with ice. 2 Pour in all the rest of the
ingredients, plus a pinch of celery salt,
and stir well. If you fancy a spicier
kick, grate ½tsp of fresh horseradish
root into it. 3 Garnish with celery.

A
mid the ﬂurry of shopping
for gifts, ﬂitting between
parties and decking the house
in its festive ﬁnery, December
can all too easily become one of the most
tiring months of the year. Thankfully, Whittard
of Chelsea has launched The Century of
Tea, a collection of 100 teas to help you
recover from the Christmas bustle, and revel

English Breakfast. Later in the day, bring

Christmas lunch SEASONAL IDEAS
Roast turkey with
polenta stuffing
TAKES 10MIN, PLUS UP TO 4HR IN
THE OVEN AND UP TO 1HR RESTING
50g butter
4.5-5.5kg turkey
500g sausagemeat
3tbsp chopped 
parsley
½tsp chopped thyme
½tsp chopped sage
1tsp lemon
juice
1tsp finely grated lemon zest  
50g polenta
2tbsp cranberry
sauce
250ml white wine
Bay
leaves and sprigs of thyme, to garnish
FOR THE GRAVY
3tbsp plain flour
4tbsp brandy
850ml turkey or
vegetable stock
1 Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F/
Gas 6. Rub the butter all over the
turkey and season well with salt and
freshly ground black pepper. Combine
the sausagemeat, parsley, thyme, sage,
lemon juice and zest, polenta and
cranberry sauce. Season with salt and
black pepper, then stuff inside the neck
cavity of the bird, saving any that is
left over to make stuffing balls (cook
these later with the bacon-wrapped
chipolatas, below right).
2 Place the turkey in a roasting tin
and put in the oven for 20min, then
turn down the heat to 180°C/350°F/
Gas 4. Pour in the white wine and
200ml water, then roast, covered
with foil, for 40min per kg, basting
occasionally. The turkey is cooked
when a meat thermometer reads
75°C, or the juices run clear when
a metal skewer is inserted into the
thickest part of the thigh.
3 Remove the turkey from the oven
and set aside on a platter to rest in
a warm place, loosely covered in foil,
for up to 1hr. Strain the pan juices into
a jug. Leave to cool while the turkey
is resting, so the fat rises to the top.
4 Skim off 3tbsp fat and put it in the
tin with the flour. Cook over a very
low heat for 2min, stirring. Slowly
add the brandy and stock to the tin,
whisking until smooth. Skim the
remaining fat off the turkey juices
in the jug. Stir the juices into the
gravy. Bring to the boil and simmer
for 2-3min until thickened. Season
with salt and pepper to taste. Pour 
into a warm gravy boat.
5 To serve the turkey, garnish it with
bay leaves and sprigs of thyme. 
Chipolatas with bacon
TAKES 5MIN PLUS 30MIN IN THE OVEN
12 streaky bacon rashers  
 12 chipolatas
1 Wrap a bacon rasher around each
chipolata, tucking the ends of the
rasher in to prevent it coming loose.
2 Place the wrapped chipolatas in
a roasting tin lined with greaseproof
paper. If you have made stuffing balls, 
place them in the tin now as well. Once
the turkey has come out of the oven,
turn the heat up to 200°C/400°F/
Gas 6, then cover the chipolata tin with
foil and place in the oven.
3 After 10min remove the foil. After
another 10min, turn the sausages and
stuffing balls. Cook for a further 10min
until cooked through.
Mushroom toasties
TAKES 15MIN
1tbsp sunflower oil
25g butter  
750g mixed mushrooms,
sliced
2 garlic cloves, crushed
4 thyme stalks, leaves picked
4tbsp dry sherry
1 ciabatta loaf,
cut into 12 slices
Olive oil, for
brushing
50g wild rocket
30g
mature Cheddar, shaved  Balsamic
vinegar, for drizzling
1 Heat half the sunflower oil and
half the butter in a pan, add half the
mushrooms and cook on a high heat 
for 5min until golden. Remove to a
plate and repeat with the remaining
oil, butter and mushrooms. Put all
the cooked mushrooms back in the
pan and add the garlic, thyme and
sherry. Simmer for a few min until
the alcohol has cooked off.
2 Brush the slices of bread with olive
oil on both sides, and grill for a few
min on each side. Place two slices
on each serving plate. Top with the
mushrooms, rocket and cheese, and
drizzle on balsamic vinegar to serve.
For a good mixture of
mushrooms, try using
oyster, chestnut and
portobello varieties

over the roasted vegetables, then
return to the oven for a few minutes.
Serve topped with extra thyme.
Beetroot, potato & Taleggio gratin

600g waxy potatoes, peeled and
very thinly sliced
1 garlic clove,

this to have on Boxing
Day with leftover turkey
The glaze brings
out the natural
sweetness of
the vegetables
2 Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/
Gas 4. Sprinkle the garlic and a little
thyme into a greased 20cm x 30cm
gratin dish. Arrange half of the potato
slices, overlapping, in the dish and
season well. Cover with the beetroot
and a little more thyme.
3 Mix the crème fraîche and milk, pour
half over the beetroot, then season. Top
with another layer of potato and pour
over the remaining milk mixture.
4 Mix the breadcrumbs, remaining
thyme and the two cheeses. Sprinkle
over the top of the dish and dot with
butter. Bake for 1hr 10min, until the
gratin is golden brown, and the cream
bubbling up around the edges.

double cream
½tbsp icing sugar
1tbsp Calvados or your favourite
festive spirit
Few fresh or

Bay leaves, brushed with edible
gold lustre, to decorate (optional) 
1 Put the raisins and sultanas
in a large bowl, then use
scissors to cut the apricots
and prunes or figs into 
Extra-fruity Christmas pudding
TAKES 6HR 20MIN, PLUS OVERNIGHT SOAKING AND COOLING
If you’re going to light
your pudding when
serving it, remove the
berries and leaves
small pieces, straight into the bowl.
Add the orange zest and juice. Coarsely
grate the unpeeled apple straight in,
working around the core. Stir in the
spices, marmalade, sherry and brandy.
Mix well, cover and leave overnight in
a cool place (not the fridge).
2 Stir the butter, eggs, flaked and
ground almonds and breadcrumbs
into the soaked fruit. Place a small
disc of greaseproof paper in the base
of a 1pt (600ml) buttered pudding
basin, pressing it down well. Put
the pudding mixture into the basin,
then cover it with a piece of pleated
nonstick baking paper and cover that
with pleated foil. Secure with string 
and create a string handle from one
side of the basin to the other.
3 Cook over boiling water in a
steamer with a tight-fitting lid for
3hr, checking the water every hour
and topping it up so it doesn’t boil
dry. You can save cooking time by
using a pressure cooker – check
its instructions for exact timings.
4 Take the basin out and leave
the pudding to cool completely.
Remove the paper and foil, and
replace with clingfilm and new foil.
Store in a cool place until needed.
5 To reheat, remove the foil, replace
the clingfilm with a sheet of
nonstick baking paper and put the
foil back on. Steam, as above, for
3hr, then leave to cool for 20min.
6 Lightly whip the double cream
with the icing sugar and alcohol.
7 Turn your pudding out onto a
plate, place a few cranberries on top
and add the decorated bay leaves. 
Serve with the boozy cream.

Grow something 
beautiful…
SORBUS
Planting as
a statement
specimen
tree in a small
garden. Its
prolific berries
offer strong
autumn colour.
Its branches
form a wide,
loose canopy,
with sprays of
small, white
flowers followed
by long lasting
yellow berries.
BEST FOR 
Coastal and
other exposed
areas. It thrives
as a street tree,
tolerating
different soils
and weather
conditions.
With its upright
habit and oval
crown, this
sorbus has
white flowers in
spring, followed
by bright, rose
pink berries.
Adding drama
and helping to
lift a dark area.
Its light canopy
and berries are
stunning offset
against the
reddish stems.
Has an open
canopy of
feathery leaves
and clusters of
delicate flowers
that attract
nectar seeking
insects in spring.
Sorbus ‘Sunshine’
Sorbus ‘Eastern Promise’
VARIETIES TO TRY 
Make a
knockout
statement
with a
tub-grown
tree known
for its winter bark.
The Himalayan
silver birch
(Betula utilis var.
jacquemontii) has
shimmering white
stems, while the
peeling bands on
the bark of the
Tibetan cherry 
(Prunus serrula) is
beautifully tactile.
But my favourite
for winter bark
is the snow gum
(Eucalyptus
pauciflora), with
its patchwork of
creamy white and
pink bark. Pot one
up in a large tub
on a patio or drive.
Buy a tall, multi-
stemmed one and
position it to catch
the waning winter 
sunshine – fairy
lights entwined in
the stems will show
them off even more.

Sorbus ‘Wisley Gold’
Sorbus (or rowan) are
decorative deciduous trees
with autumn and winter
berries in a variety of colours,
including white, pink, orange
and blue, while the red berries
are a winter favourite with
birds. Many Sorbus have small
spring flowers, too.
HOW TO GROW Sorbus trees do
best on fertile, well-drained soil, not
unlike on a mountain slope. Although
they appreciate moist summers, they
don’t like chalky soils or damp soil
around the roots. They prefer full sun
or dappled shade, and can cope with
exposure. As many species of rowan
are quite compact, they’re ideal for
small gardens. Underplant with
early flowering hellebores or bulbs,
such as crocus. A good tip from the
Victorians was to plant them on
a mound to ensure good drainage.
For pretty pink
berries that last
into December,

WHY WE LOVE THEM… Hi-tech toys
aren’t new – I mean, who didn’t have a
Tamagotchi in their stocking in the mid-
Nineties? However, the latest toys are
increasingly complex – think Meccano
robots you can interact with and magic
tricks you can do with your phone. Even
the gaming experience has moved on
– now, instead of staring at a TV screen,
you can wear futuristic headgear and
be fully immersed in a virtual reality.
PRODUCTS WE LOVE… I predict that
Meccano’s Meccanoids will be popular
this year – I also suspect that most kids
won’t get a look-in as Mum and Dad
fulfil their dreams of building their own
robot. Virtual Reality (VR) headsets will
be big news, too – those, such as
Oculus’s Rift and HTC’s Vive, have a
built-in screen and plug into a computer
or games console for the ultimate 360°
experience with a price tag to match.
However, there are more affordable
options that have a slot in the front for
your phone – just download a few apps
to get a feel for what VR has to offer.
From Meccano to magic sets, traditional favourites
are being souped up for 21st-century boys and girls

FEATURES WE LOVE
1
The system’s simple setup. All you
have to do is plug the Hub into a power
socket and your router, and download the
SmartThings app to your iOS, Android
or Windows Phone. You can then add
as many devices as you like and control
them through the app, wherever you are.
2
Its four devices. There’s a Motion
Sensor, which will send a notification
to your smartphone if it detects
movement, and a Multi Sensor that will
alert you if a window, door or cat flap
opens or closes. There’s also a Presence
Sensor that you can attach to, say, a kid’s
backpack, so you’ll know they’ve arrived
home from school safely. Finally, the
Power Outlet can be used to control
any appliance that’s plugged into it
– a godsend for those ‘I’ve left the iron
on’ moments. It can also be set to a timer, 
so you could fire up the coffee maker
automatically every morning, provided it
only needs to be turned on at the mains.
3
Its compatibility. It works with
hundreds of devices, including Bose
speakers, Honeywell’s Wi-Fi heating
control, Philips Hue and Lifx light bulbs, 
Yale smart locks, D-Link’s smart video
camera and more Samsung products,
such as a Moisture Sensor to detect
leaks. Look out for the ‘Works with
SmartThings’ logo, and you’ll know that
you can add the gadget to your system.
4
You can create rules for any
eventuality. Press ‘I’m Home’ and you
could get the door to unlock and a light
and music to come on. Or set a timer to
get that coffee brewing and to wake you
up gently with a sunrise simulation from
a Hue bulb. All it takes is a few clicks 
and the possibilities are endless

that the tastiest brew comes
from grinding the beans on

Spread the party to every corner of your
home this Christmas with connected speakers
Girl About Tech explains…
WHAT ARE THEY? Listening to
music in every room used to mean one
of three things – having an expensive
audio system installed, wearing a
Walkman at all times or turning up
the hi-ﬁto ‘11’. But thankfully for
your bank balance, social skills and
neighbours, you can now get yourself
a multi-room system. Place its wireless
speakers around your home and you
can connect to them to send a single
song to one or more speakers at
the same time. Some systems
also let you play different music in
different rooms, all controlled by  
just one smartphone or tablet.
WHAT DO I NEED? You can start
out with just a single speaker and add
as you go, but be aware that systems
often aren’t cross-compatible
with other brands, and will vary
in terms of qualilty and functions.
Powerful Wi-Fi-based systems
such as Sonos, will let you send
music from different sources
to different places, so you
can send a Spotify playlist
to your living room, local
radio to the kitchen and
tracks from your iTunes
library to the bedroom.
Traditionally, these systems
required a ‘bridge’ – a box that
plugged into your router – however,
these are increasingly scarce.
More simplistic multi-room
speakers, like those offered by
Philips and Ruark, are easier
to set up just by pressing a few
buttons on the speaker itself,
but they only let you stream
the same track between places. 
Multi-room

FEATURE AMY CUTMORE ILLUSTRATIONS MONIKA ROE

CONNECT
THE SPEAKERS
In the case of Wi-Fi systems, ﬁrst
download the free companion app
and make sure your smartphone or
tablet is connected to your home
Wi-Fi network. Now power up your
speaker, open the app and select
‘add a new speaker’ – you might
need to press a pairing button on
the speaker, too. Some systems
have an extra step that optimises
the sound depending on where
you place the speaker in the room.
CHOOSE
A SYSTEM
The multi-room system you
pick will depend on what’s most
important to you. Do you value supreme
audio quality over everything else, or
are you after something that’s easy,
fun and affordable? Do you want similar
speakers in each room, or would
you prefer a wider range of options?
Samsung, for example, lets you add
soundbars and TVs to its system,
while Philips and Panasonic both
include CD players in their line-up.

MULTI-ROOM 
SYSTEMS
CREATE ZONES
Once you’ve added a few
speakers, you’ll usually have
the option to group them
together – for example, by room –
so they’re easier to control. Some
systems also let you pair up
individual speakers to re-create
left-right stereo separation or
even a full 5.1 surround-sound
experience. However, you might 
be limited in the number of
speakers that will play the same
song at once. In the case of Philips’
Izzy basic Bluetooth system, you can
group together up to ﬁve speakers,
whereas for others, there’s no limit! 
SUBSCRIBE TO
MORE MUSIC
With your music collection easier
to access than ever, it’s inevitable
you’ll tire of your own library of songs
– yes, even Everybody (Backstreet’s
Back). That’s why lots of multi-room
speakers can be used alongside music
services like Spotify, TuneIn Radio
and Google Play Music, putting
millions more (and possibly
less-embarrassing) tracks at your
disposal. Once you’ve subscribed,
systems like Sonos and Bose will
let you access the service through
their controller app. Also look out for
speakers that support Spotify Connect.
These stream tracks from your Spotify
account directly over Wi-Fi, rather than
using your phone as a medium, so when you 
go to answer a call, the tunes won’t stop.
4
CONVERT OLDER 
EQUIPMENT
Plenty of wireless systems
– such as those from
Denon, Samsung and Pure
– let you integrate older
equipment via an adaptor.
In some cases, you can
even hook up a turntable
and play vinyl through the
house, which should please
those who think analogue
sound is superior to digital.

Hailed by the New York Times as
‘The French revolution of the 20th
century’, the Magimix is one of only
a handful of appliances that’s truly
iconic. With such fans as Mary Berry
and ‘Deliciously Ella’ Woodward,
its success has a lot to do with its
roots – it was invented by a French
catering-equipment salesman
to help his pro-chef clients prep
ingredients. Today, the processor
motor is guaranteed for 30 years,
so you can be sure it will be a long-
lasting helping hand in your kitchen

Enjoy the special touch that candles add to your home, but take care to use them safely:
Always place lit candles well away from foliage, furniture, curtains and soft furnishings,
and always out of draughts
Keep candles out of reach of children and pets
 Never leave 
a burning candle unattended
Keep candles away from hair and clothing  
Always place candles upright in suitable holders that can’t easily
fall over
 Always be sure that candles are properly extinguished
