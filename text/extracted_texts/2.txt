Introduction
Seeking ecological and healthy ways to stimulate one’s well-being and growth
is one of the most important trends in today’s psychology (Moser, 2009; Horelli &
Prezza, 2004). Ironically, the home as the very basic “” has not attracted until
now much research focus. Home is the primary, basic and relatively constant space
in human life that meets a person’s basic needs, stimulates development and also
carries a psychotherapeutic function. Even when a person has no home, the home’s
image itself appears to be the source of a person’s support (Bochaver, 2015; Dovey,
1985; Case, 1996; Nartova-Bochaver, Bochaver, Dmitrieva, & Reznichenko, 2016;
Abstract
In a questionnaire study with N = 1730 participants aged from 11 to 72 years (M = 20.4, Me = 19,
SD = 6.96), 60% female, we developed the Relevance of the Home Environment Questionnaire
(RHEQ) aimed at measuring parameters of the home environment as the inhabitants’ eco-social
resource. Results from exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses showed that the seven-fac-
tor structure of the questionnaire was uniquely formulated. The scales were titled as follows:
Privacy, Potential, Self-presentation, Ergonomics, Home detachment, Plasticity, and Historicity.
Consistency coefficients (Cronbach’s alpha) of scales ranged from .91 to .94. Age trends in four
out of seven scales were found. Potential scores were higher in women, while Home detach-
ment — in men. Content validity was investigated by comparison of home relevance scores in
students living in their own homes or dormitories. Convergent validity was explored by measur-
ing correlations of the scales with the Functionality of the Home Environment Questionnaire
and the Home Attachment Scale. All psychometric properties are satisfactory. Data was dis-
cussed with regard to possible applications in research, expertise, and psychotherapy. 
Keywords: home environment, person-environment fit, validation, relevance, affordance, func -
tionality, home attachment.

Nartova-Bochaver, Reznichenko, Braginetc, & Podlipnyak, 2015). At the same
time, research on relationships between home and its inhabitants has been ham-
pered by the lack of a valid measure. Methodological tools in environmental psy-
chology primarily allow us to estimate only the physical attributes of a dwelling
(location, footage, furnishings) but rarely take into account the individual needs of
each inhabitant (Boumeester, 2011; Bradley, Caldwell, & Elardo, 1979; Heft, 1979,
1985; Jansen, Coolen, & Goetgeluk, 2011). Furthermore, usually there are either
interviews or projective techniques that are used as research methods, therefore
the results may not be unambiguous and often need additional verification (Skifter
Andersen, 2011), except some initial inventories developed for children’s home
environments decades ago (e.g., Bradley et al., 1979; Heft, 1979, 1985). There exist
only few for assessing the psychological resources of environment for adult individ-
uals, and there are no such tools in Russia at all. This is due to the multidimension-
ality of the concept of home and, therefore, different points of the analysis of rela-
tionships between home and its inhabitants.
Researchers and theorists have presented a variety of definitions for the concept
of home. P. Somerville (1992) argued that home has at least six dimensions of
meaning identified by the ‘key signifiers’ of shelter, hearth, heart, privacy, roots and
abode. After G. Hayward (1975), home can be considered as a physical structure, a
territory, a locus in space, self and self-identity, a social and cultural unit. A.
Rapoport (1995) referred to three semiotic units of living environment: 1) home as
a building with its spatial characteristics, architecture and design; 2) home as a
dwelling (functional space) where a person performs various daily activities; 3)
home as a place with intrapersonal meanings (meanings). In similar way, H. Coolen
and J. Meesters (2012) suggest sharing the concepts of house, dwelling and home.
‘House’ is commonly used in housing research and describes the physical objective
structures we live in. A dwelling is defined as a system of settings that affords dif-
ferent functions and activities (eating, relaxing, entertaining, etc.). While the con-
cept of home connotes with positive feelings and affective bonds based on the tem-
poral (e.g. home as the place where one was born) and social (e.g. home as a “family
nest”) individual experience and meanings we attach to the living space. 
We understand home as integrity of physical, social, and existential properties of
a specific place satisfying inhabitants’ needs (for security, comfort, identity, etc.). In
the normative case, home is present through the course of the life of a person, is bio-
graphically connected with his/her history and therefore reflects individuality,
expresses identity and stimulates personal authenticity. Following the Lens model of
Brunswik (1956), Gibson’s theory of affordances (1986), Person-Environment Fit
theory (Edwards, Caplan, & Harrison, 1998; Kahana, Lovegreen, Kahana, & Kahana,
2003), the concept of environmental friendliness (Chemero, 2003; Coolen, 2011;
Coolen & Hoekstra, 2001; Greeno, 1994; Horelli, 2007; Horelli & Prezza, 2004;
Kyttä, 2004) and the subject-environmental approach (Nartova-Bochaver, 2008), we
believe that the interaction between a person and their home occurs on several levels. 
The non-psychological level defines a place as a house, but not as a home. This
level is set by the quality of housing, – for example, its location, type, size or num-
ber of inhabitants sharing the same living space.
The Relevance of the Home Environment Questionnaire
69
The objective level is set by the physical qualities of home as a living environ-
ment represented in the degree of functionality of the home environment — various
functions and activities that home performs for its inhabitants (i.e. meeting the
needs for privacy, development, health management, commu nica tion with family
members, etc.). Initially the functions of home environment can’t be maladaptive
(Gosling, Ko, Mannarelli, & Morris, 2002). The more functions a home can per-
form, the higher number of people it can potentially fit, but the presence of a large
number of different functions does not necessarily make it an “ideal home”, because
some functions are unconscious due to their irrelevance for a particular person (for
example, a playground near the house won’t be a significant attribute of the home
environment for families without children). 
The intermediate level, or the relevance of home environment, is a degree to
which the inhabitant’s needs and environmental characteristics match. This level
includes a system of affordances — dispositional properties of environments and
functionally meaningful ‘relations between abilities to perceive and act and fea-
tures of the environment’ (Chemero, 2009, p. 150). The process of perceiving affor-
dances is not the same for all people sharing the same space as others’ bodily fea-
tures and values differ from ours. According to the theory of environmental friend-
liness the more affordances the environment includes, the friendlier it is to its
inhabitant (Chemero, 2003; Coolen, 2011; Kyttä, 2004). As H. Coolen (2011)
wrote, “Individuals selectively engage particular objects in their surroundings;
individuals typically make choices from among the range of potential features in a
setting to support some activity. However, individuals do not have unconstrained
choice. <…> So there is self-selection of affordances but often within constraints”
(p. 5). 
Finally, the deepest level of psychological analysis shows the people-home rela-
tionship is subjective. The subjective level reflects a system of personal experiences
and meanings, positive feelings and attitudes towards a home that are integrated
into a sense of home attachment de ned as a complex of positive experiences and
feelings toward home as a personally relevant place in functional, emotional and
symbolic meanings. We assume that home attachment is a kind of place attachment
and has a similar structure, manifestations and development mechanisms
(Jorgensen & Stedman, 2006; Lewicka, 2011; Reznichenko, 2014; Scannell & Gifford,
2017). Home attachment positively affects the psychological health, well-being and
authenticity (Manzo, 2003; Reznichenko, 2016). 
We previously developed a set of tools that only allowed the study of two levels
of person-home interaction: The Functionality of the Home Environment
Questionnaire (FHEQ) was designed to assess the objective level and measure var-
ious functions presented in the home environment so that an objective level is pos-
sible in relation to the home (Nartova-Bochaver, Dmitrieva, Reznichenko, Kuznetsova,
& Braginets, 2015); the second one, Home Attachment Scale (HAS), allows the explo-
ration of the subjective level of analysis and measures the person-to-home
emotional bonds (Reznichenko, Nartova-Bochaver, & Kuznetsova, 2016). In this
article, our aim was to describe a technique that allows measuring how much the
inhabitants feel their home suits them, reflects their individuality and meets their
70
S.I. Reznichenko, S.K. Nartova-Bochaver, E.I. Braginets
basic needs; a subjectively perceived preference of what we call a relevant home. In
other words, we would investigate the “compatibility” between people and their
home that represents the intermediate level (subject-environmental) of person-
home relationship.
As Heft (2012) rightly noted, to proceed in making an assessment of the psy-
chological resources, several steps are required: “(1) particular possibilities need to
be proposed for what may serve as an eco-psychological resource (e.g., a particular
type of affordance); (2) a means of assessing the availability of these resources in
some local needs to be developed; and crucially, (3) linkages between availability
of these resources and positive outcomes must be established” (Ibid., p. 26). And
we can say, in the current study, these steps towards development of the multi-fac-
torial questionnaire have been taken into consideration. 
Participants and Procedure
Sample. In total, 1730 respondents aged from 11 to 72 (Mage = 20.4; Meage = 19.0,
SDage = 6.96, 62,2 % female) participated in our surveys. Most respondents were
recruited from Moscow universities. Adult respondents were recruited mainly
from students’ families using the technique that became known as “snow ball”.
Participation in the survey was absolutely voluntary, students were granted an aca-
demic credit as compensation. The program of the survey was approved by the
Ethical Committee of the National Research University Higher School of
Economics. The survey was realized using the “patchwork” design: not all respon-
dents participated in all studies but most of them did. Sample 1 (preliminary study,
development of the item pool) included 186 participants, Muscovites, (Mage = 23.9,
SDage = 4.9, 55.9 % female). Sample 2 (exploratory analysis, reducing the number of
questionnaire items) consisted of 431 participants from Moscow and other regions,
students from different faculties (Mage = 20.5, SDage = 10.1, 72.2% female). Sample 3
(factor analysis, internal consistency) comprised of 1051 participants from
Moscow and other regions, students from different faculties (Mage = 20.5, SDage =
10.1, 72.2% female). Sample 4 (external validity: age trend and gender differences)
included 332 respondents (Mage = 26.8; SDage=13.2; 54.8% female) divided into four
age groups (82 adolescents 12–17; 76 young adults aged 18–24; 87 adults aged 25–
45, and 87 late adults aged 46–72. Sample 5 (content validity) included 434
respondents. 227 of them were Muscovites living with their parents mostly, all sin-
gle (Mage = 22.1, SDage = 0.92; 71.6% female). Other 207 came to Moscow from dif-
ferent regions of Russia and lived in dormitories where they had to share their
rooms with 2–3 other students (Mage = 21.7, SDage = 0.65; 78.7% female). Sample 6
(construct validity) consisted of 719 individuals aged from 18 to 40 (Mage = 21.92,
SDage = 6.90; 71.2% female), who were students and graduates from Moscow univer-
sities. 
We used web-based data collection. The respondents were required to fill out
questionnaires incorporating a forced-choice question format. There was no time
limit to complete the questionnaires.

71
Measures. The Functionality of the Home Environment Questionnaire
(FHEQ) and The Home Attachment Scale (HAS) were used to measure the con-
vergent validity of the new instrument.
FHEQ was aimed to assess the functions provided by the home to its dwellers
(Nartova-Bochaver et al., 2015). The questionnaire consists of 55 statements and
four subscales (Pragmatism, Development, Stability, and Protection). Examples of
FHEQ items are as follows: “My home … 1) demonstrates the dwellers’ wealth,
2) is accessible (geographically and financially), 3) is spacious 4) gives an opportu-
nity to care for myself, etc. In the current study, Cronbach’s alphas were from 0.82
to 0.93 for all subscales.
The Home Attachment Scale (HAS) indicates the level of a person’s positive
emotional connectedness to his/her home (Reznichenko et al., 2016). It includes
14 statements and only one scale. Examples of the items are as follows: “I identify
myself strongly with my home”, “My home says a lot about who I am”, “I am willing
to put my heart and soul into my home”. In this study, alpha was 0.89. 
Results
Development of the Item Pool
To collect a prior pool of statements, firstly we analyzed the sources in the fields
of social, environmental, recreational psychology and social anthropology to iden-
tify the person’s needs satisfied by their home (Boumeester, 2011; Coolen, 2011;
Depres, 1991; Ingold, 2002). Then, during the empirical research, the list of con-
structs identified theoretically was enlarged (Sample 1). Participants (Sample 1)
were invited to take part in a ladder interview on the topic of the desired image of
a home. Also, respondents were asked to evaluate interiors of rooms and dwellings
using the minimum context method by Kelly and to name the meaningful home
qualities (Kelly, 1991). Finally, we used a number of creative tasks such as incom-
plete sentence test and essay exercises. 
As a result, this study has identified 54 characteristics of home environment
that meet multilevel needs of inhabitants (for rest, for safety, for family interaction,
for home space changeability, for ergonomics and aesthetics, for self-presentation
and self-development, etc.). Two statements were formulated for each construct
(total 108 statements); the questionnaire items’ wording had to reflect the personal
opinion of the respondent on the possibilities of his own home. The ratio of inverse
and direct statement formulations were 1:7. The degree of agreement/disagree-
ment with the statements was evaluated on a five-point Likert scale. To ensure the
respondents understood the instruction and to correct controversial statements, a
focused interview was conducted. The primary version of the questionnaire was
offered to the group of respondents (Sample 1) for feedback on the content, struc-
ture and clarity of the statement wordings for convenience of filling out the ques-
tionnaire. 
Next, we conducted an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to determine the pre-
liminary structure of the questionnaire and narrow down to the number of variables
72
S.I. Reznichenko, S.K. Nartova-Bochaver, E.I. Braginets
(Sample 2). The method of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) with Varimax
rotation was used to calculate factors. The criterion of Kaiser’s eigenvalues (k > 1)
showed only one optimal model consisting of seven factors. Since sometimes this
criterion shows an inadequately large number of factors, an additional Scree-plot
test was performed that confirmed the seven-factor structure. The EFA allowed us
to reduce all the items with low factor loadings and to reduce the questionnaire
length from 108 statements to 35 items (5 items per scale). 
Dimensional Structure of the RHEQ
The reduced version of the questionnaire was reanalyzed with EFA using the
Varimax rotation of factors. As previously the seven-factor solution was revealed
(the questionnaire structure with factor loadings is presented in Figure 1). We used
the final statement list in our further work on this questionnaire (Appendix A). 
The performance of the model was evaluated (Sample 3) by examining the
ensemble of “goodness-of-fit” statistics, such as the Root Mean Squared Error of
Figure 1
Factor Loadings of the Seven-Factor Solution of RHEQ
The Relevance of the Home Environment Questionnaire
73
Approximation (RMSEA), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR),
the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI). According to
conventional agreements, all the indices except chi-squared test indicate a good fit
of model (CFI > 0.9, TLI > 0.9, SRMR < 0.5) (Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen,
2008). The insufficient level of chi-squared significance can be explained by a large
sample (> 200), so the Chi-Square statistic nearly always rejects the model in this
case (Bentler & Bonnet, 1980). Table 1 shows the results of confirmatory factor
analysis.
The titles of the scales were as follows. (1) Self-presentation is associated with
the inhabitants’ possibility to personalize their own space and to signify the indi-
vidual and social characteristics of the dwellers through the home environment.
(2) Ergonomics describes home environment convenience and aesthetics. (3) Po -
ten tial includes constructs associated with home support and stability. (4) Privacy
is associated with the capability to control and predict a home environment con-
text. (5) Home Detachment is concerned with reasons of home estrangement, loss
of home attachment and sense of belonging. This scale includes statements related
to discomfort, inconvenience, low functionality of a living space, and lack of desire
to come back home. We have not reversed this scale (i.e. haven’t measured ‘home
detachment’ in a positive direction) to prevent confusion with the concept of
Home Attachment. (6) Plasticity determines the capability of the home environ-
ment to be dynamic in accordance with the changing resident’s needs.
(7) Historicity reflects the links of a home with the personal, family, and general past. 
The average score is calculated for each subscale. Evaluation of the overall level
of home environment relevance is performed by summing up the average values of
seven scales, except for the Home Detachment scale, the rate of which is subtracted
from the total.
Descriptive Statistics and Internal Consistency
Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics and unexpectedly high coefficients of
internal consistency (taking into account the small number of items in each scale)
ranging from .91 to .94. Thus, we have obtained initial norms; all Cronbach’s alpha
values are satisfactory confirming the test to be highly reliable. 
The most considerable variability is revealed in Historicity and Self-presentation
scores, this potentially indicates that the intensity of these needs depends more on
latent variables, for example, the respondent’s gender or age. Privacy scale has the
lowest variability of scores — probably this need is the most universal and signifi-
cant for the whole population.

External Validity
External validity of the questionnaire was evaluated via ANOVA and post hoc
analysis of the variances in different ages and gender populations (Sample 4).
Age trends. Although there were not significant differences between age groups
(F3; 329 = 0.632; p = .590) regarding general index of RHEQ, they were found in four
of the seven scales in the questionnaire, namely: Potential (F3; 329 = 5.955; p = .001),
Ergonomics (F3; 329 = 4.792; p = .003), Plasticity (F3; 329 = 9.423; p = .000), and
Historicity (F3; 329 = 5.637; p = .001) (Figure 2). The Games-Howell post hoc test
allowed obtaining the following results. In late adulthood Potential of the home
scale index is significantly higher than in adults (p  .050), young adults (p  .002),
and especially in adolescents (p  .000). Ergonomics indices are significantly higher
in adolescents than in young adults (p  .047) and in adults (p  .002). Plasticity
is equally less significant in adolescents and young adults, than in adults (p = 0.001
and p = .006, respectively) and in late adults (p = .000 and p = .002, respectively):
flexible home is more important in adulthood than in youth. Finally, adolescents
and young people had higher scores (p = .004 in both groups) on the Historicity
scale than the adults. 
Gender differences. Analysis of gender differences showed that Home
Detachment (F1; 331 = 5.804; p  .017) is higher in the male group, while Potential
scores (F1; 331 = 4.114; p  .023) are higher in women. 
Content Validity
In order to test whether RHEQ adequately reflects real significance (relevance) of
the home affordances for its inhabitant, we compared the data of students who lived
in parental homes or their own apartments, and those who resided in dormitories. 
Comparing RHEQ indices of students with different living conditions (using
ANOVA), we found that those who lived in their own homes have a higher overall
RHEQ rate (F1; 433 = 85.681; p   .000) than others as well as rates of all the ‘positive’
scales: Privacy (F1; 433 = 34.641; p  .000), Self-presentation (F1; 433 = 27.451; p  .000),

Ergonomics (F1; 433 = 38.378; p  .000), Plasticity (F1;433 = 34.752; p  .000); high intergroup
differences were especially observed in Potential (F1; 433 = 74.440; p .000) and Historicity
(F1; 433 = 64.943; p  .000) scores. At the same time, Home Detachment indices are lower
in this group of respondents (F1; 433 = 6.272; p  .013). This data is presented in Figure 3.

the Home Environment (is measured by the FHEQ) and Home Attachment
(HAS) were used. As shown in Table 3, all the scales of RHEQ, except the Home
Detachment scale, have a significant positive relationship (p  .000) with the
scales of the FHEQ and Home Attachment scale, while Home Detachment has sig-
nificant negative relations (p  .000). The strongest correlations are found
between Potential, Ergonomics, Self-presentation and the FHEQ and Home
Attachment scales. A weak negative correlation was received only between the
Home Detachment and Protection scales.
Discussion
Based on the Theories of Affordances (Gibson, 1986) and Person-Environment
Fit (Coolen & Hoekstra, 2001; Horelli, 2007; Kyttä, 2004) as well as on multidis-
ciplinary works devoted to wholesome impacts of the home environment on indi-
viduals’ well-being (Casakin & Bernard, 2012; Heft, 2012; Ingold, 2002) the
Relevance of the Home Environment Questionnaire was developed. The aim of
this instrument is to measure the extent to which the affordability of home is able
to meet the various needs of the dwellers (relevant to dwellers). 
While creating the initial statements pool, we assumed the understanding of the
home both as the archetypal phenomenon and as a private living space at the same
time. That is why in the very beginning we selected from multidisciplinary sources
those well-known functions that home had in different times and cultures. Then,
through a series of empirical studies, this list was enlarged by functions, which are
performed in homes of modern Russians in their everyday lives. Since there is a
high diversity in living conditions in Russia, and traditional Russian families are

multigenerational, these constructs reflect the experiences associated with living
in different dwellings such as separate rural houses, buildings with a few apart-
ments or apartment blocks. This has contributed to the representation of the test
statements and the expansion of the target audience within its users (e.g.
researchers, practitioners).
Due to exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses seven scales were identi-
fied: Privacy, Potential, Self-presentation, Ergonomics, Home Detachment, Plasticity,
and Historicity scales. The new tool seems to have good psychometric properties:
Cronbach’s alphas are ranged between .91 and .94. Investigation into age trends
showed that the RHEQ scores environment features formed specific patterns (pro-
files) in every one of the investigated ages. Thus, the Potential and Plasticity scales
have highest meanings in late adults, in full accordance with life styles of elderly
people who usually spend a lot of time at home and get support and stability from
their homes mainly, but not from jobs. Similar trends are shown in M. Lawton and
L. Nahemow’s (1973) ecological model of aging (Competence-Press Model theory)
that conceptualizes the individual as having a set of competences, and the environ-
ment as a ‘press’ or having the characteristic of making demands upon the individ-
ual. As the levels of competence gradually decrease with age (due to age health
problems, tendency to social and physical inactivity, decreased functioning of
the nervous system, etc.), adaptation to living conditions requires a flexible, adapt-
able, and stable living environment.
At the same time, Historicity scores are higher in adolescents and youth because
as the proportion of life experience just in their current houses is higher in these
age groups, than it is for the older group. Finally, Ergonomics of the home environ-
ment is more relevant for teenagers than for older people. This may be due to the
fact that the home for a teenager is not only a place of relaxation and recovery, but
also a place for doing homework and networking with classmates that requires
comfortable user-friendly conditions (Jonkmann, Thoemmes, Lüdtke, & Traut -
wein, 2014). The Privacy, Self-presentation and Home Detachment (in terms of
opposing positive connotations – the overall satisfaction with the living environ-
ment) scales have no differences that are age dependent, probably emphasizing the
universal nature of these needs.
We have also found gender differences: Home Detachment scores are higher in
men while Potential scores are higher in women. Whereas women are mostly the
ones who engage in housekeeping and more often than men work from home, they
need affordable, stable and supportive living environments at home to facilitate dif-
ferent home activities. At the same time, men do not cope with domestic problems
as easily as women do (Graham & Graham, 1989).  
Calculation of the RHEQ scores in the samples of respondents living in differ-
ent conditions (homes and dormitories) showed that all meanings were higher in
students living in homes, and the Home Detachment score was significantly lower,
thus giving good evidence for construct validity of the new tool. This is the expect-
ed result, because students who live in their own or their parents’ homes are less
limited in residential facilities and are not constrained by the rules and require-
ments of communal housing as experienced by dormitory residents.

The correlation between the RHEQ and other environmental tools (FHEQ and
HAS) was significant and positive, whereas the Home Detachment scale formed sig-
nificant negative links with them. This confirms a good convergent validity of the
new questionnaire: numbers of home functions as well as attachment to homes are
in mutual relationship to the extent to which a home matches its inhabitants.
Naturally, people who are attached to their homes personalize them more strongly
and, in turn, this makes their homes more congruent to them.
To sum up, all these results uniquely demonstrate the good psychometric prop-
erties of the new instrument.
Conclusions and Limitations
The aim of the study was to develop the Relevance of the Home Environment
Questionnaire as a tool to assess the person-home fit. It was stimulated by a broad
list of applied tasks as follows: seeking empirical proof to the apartment-therapy,
expertise of living spaces, the exploration of restorative and potential functions in
various building environments, design of dwellers-friendly flats, homes, dormito-
ries, hostels, hospitals, etc. The new RHEQ tool appears to be very helpful in solv-
ing these problems.
Before discussing further implications, we want to point out some limitations of
the current study. Firstly, most tests of the RHEQ validity were realized in a stu-
dents’ sample. Secondly, our work did not deal with data on objectively verifiable
characteristics of home (density, availability of personal space, length of residence,
etc.), which makes the RHEQ content validity slightly less convincing. In future
research we plan to observe the objective home characteristics more carefully.
At the same time, the development of RHEQ allows further testing of the the-
oretical positions, in addition to examining the questions that emerge from this
article. For example: How does home as a physical space determine family climate?
How does home influence the work-family balance in the inhabitants’ life styles?
Least but not last, how can friendly homes contribute to the “higher” personality
traits and virtues of their inhabitants?
There are multiple new areas of home environment study in both applied psychol-
ogy and environmental psychology research. We hope that the development of RHEQ
will aid these research endeavors and support social and therapeutic applications.

Резюме
Статья посвящена описанию валидизации нового опросника «Релевантность домашней
среды», измеряющему разнообразные параметры дома как экосоциального источника
психологического благополучия человека. В исследовании участвовали 1730 респондентов
в возрасте от 11 до 72 лет (Mвозр. = 20.4, Meвозр. = 19, SDвозр. = 6.96; 60% женского пола).
Результаты факторного анализа подтвердили наличие семифакторной структуры
опросника, состоящей из шкал: Приватность, Ресурсность, Самопрезентация,
Эргономичность, Отчужденность от домашней среды, Пластичность и Историчность.
Опросник показал высокие коэффициенты надежности (альфа Кронбаха), варьирующие в
диапазоне от .91 до .94. Репрезентативность опросника исследовалась путем анализа
возрастных и гендерных трендов. На основе анализа данных респондентов была
обнаружена возрастная специфика выраженности четырех из семи шкал. Показатели по
шкале Ресурсность оказались значимо выше в женской группе, в то время как показатели
Отчужденности от дома — в мужской. Содержательная валидность опросника оценивалась
посредством пошкального сопоставления данных респондентов студенческого возраста,
проживающих в своих собственных домах, и студентов, проживающих в общежитии.
Описаны результаты оценки конвергентной валидности, основанные на результатах
корреляционного анализа шкал Релевантности домашней среды со шкалами опросников
Функциональность домашней среды и Привязанность к дому. Опросник имеет
удовлетворительные психометрические свойства и может быть использован в области
психологии домашней среды и психотерапии как инструмент экспертизы жизненной
среды человека.
Ключевые слова: домашняя среда, субъект-средовое соответствие, оценка валидности,
релевантность, допущения, функциональность, привязанность к дому.
