HOME COMMUNITY
My to-do list
for November
The things I’ll be planning, doing 
and shopping for this month
N
ow that winter’s set in, I’m
claiming the cosiest sofa spot,
dusting off my needlework  
box and craving hot puddings…
DOING THINGS WITH APPLES It turns
out that the apple tree at the bottom of
the garden of my new house is a proliﬁc
fruiter. Being a ‘waste not, want not’ kind
of person, I’ve been diligently storing
all the apples wrapped in newspaper in
the garage, giving rise to all manner of
apple-related projects: oven-dried apple
slices; baked apples; stewed apples; apple
printing with the littlest Richmonds… but
strictly no apple pies or apple crumbles
because I am now a fully paid-up member
of WeightWatchers and on a mission to
be back in a size 12 by Christmas. Now
I’ve gone public, I’ll have to stick to it!
REVIVING OLD HOBBIES The WW
regime means my usual winter weekend
pleasures have been curtailed somewhat.
Once the chores are done and any
visiting Richmonds and/or associates
have been safely seen off the premises,
I would normally launch myself onto the
sofa, armed with a large bar of Galaxy and
a snifter, to binge-
watch Homes Under
the Hammer or
Escape to the Country
(I have a soft spot for
the ruddy-cheeked Jules
Hudson). But Galaxy’s on
the banned list and snifters
are limited to one delicious
G&T (Hendricks mixed with
Fevertree tonic, cucumber
slices and a couple of basil
leaves), so I’m keeping my
mind off fat- and sugar-
based foods by picking up
long-abandoned knitting
and cross-stitch projects.
BUYING VINTAGE Quite a
while ago now, I interviewed an
antiques expert, Toma Haines of
antiquesdiva.com, for a feature.
She spoke so passionately about the
emotional value of old things, rather
than their monetary or historical value,
I’ve been toying with the idea of buying
something vintage for my own home.
So far, I haven’t had the conﬁdence
to haggle with a dealer or make a bid,
but recently I’ve shifted my focus to
furnitureetc.co.uk – a new marketplace
site for one-off, preloved furniture that
sorts the wheat from the chaff for you.
I’ve got my eye on a retro drinks trolley
(to make those snifters a real event…),
but if you’re into shabby-chic, industrial or
traditional style, you’ll ﬁnd lots to love, too.

Heritage
fabric houses
Iconic brands are weaving their magic
with inspiring design collaborations 
THE NEXT BIG THING
THE STORY SO FAR In a creative mix  
of innovation, tradition and British
eccentricity, established fabric houses are
forging strong relationships with designers
and high-street retailers to bring their
designs to a new audience.
WHERE WE’VE SEEN IT Liberty’s latest
collection, Secret Garden, features leaf and
floral prints both dense and dainty in linen,
velvet and satin. A recent collaboration
sees Liberty Art Fabrics as cover fabric
options at Sofas & Stuff. Vanessa Arbuthnott
worked with spinners and weavers in the
Outer Hebrides to create Harris Tweed for
her Birds and Beasts collection, after her
artist daughter Rose brought back home-
spun fabrics from a painting tour there.
LATEST RELEASES Artist and theorist
William Morris was at the centre of
the radical Arts and Crafts movement,
which still inspires designers today.
Purveyor of bold and beautiful prints
House of Hackney has reimagined three
patterns from the Morris archive for a new
generation, while Leeds-based Abraham
Moon & Sons is making quality wool
fabrics for Marks & Spencer sofas,
as well as bold throws and cushions.

A
rtist and designer Laura
Oakes specialises in a
striking digital decoupage
technique, which is created
by layering eclectic images, antique
illustrations and a combination of her
own photographs and drawings in
a bold colour palette. She started out
creating one-off pieces for clients
before launching a range for Liberty,
and this year was invited to be one
of Debenhams’ Edition designers,
showcasing an exclusive collection of
cushions, lampshades and accessories.
‘I believe that everyone has the right
to own art – it should be accessible,
not elitist,’ says Laura. ‘So when
Debenhams approached me, I felt it
was a great way of making my work
available to a much wider audience.’
Based in a studio-cum-gallery in
Rye, East Sussex, Laura creates and
prints her designs digitally, then
transfers them to a range of products,
which are all made in the UK. Her
collections are constantly changing
to incorporate new ideas and styles.
‘I’m currently working on a more
reﬁned and limited-edition collection
of homeware, as well as experimenting
on a range of leather jackets with
celebrity stylist Rachel Anthony and
her consultancy The Cabal,’ explains
Laura. ‘This is my ﬁrst foray into
fashion and I’m really excited to
see how my designs translate into
a different medium.’
THE WOMAN BEHIND THE LOOK
Born and brought up in Brighton,
Laura enjoyed spending time
outdoors, climbing trees, or at the
beach searching for shells and
treasure with her father and younger
brother. ‘Growing up, my role model
was my grandfather,’ says Laura.
‘He was a quiet man, gentle and
thoughtful, always doing things for

other people with no hidden agenda.
This is something I’ve always thought
important – to be genuine in spirit and
in thought. I also spent a lot of time
with my aunt, who worked as a restorer
at the Brighton Pavilion, and this is
where I feel my inspiration for the
exotic and extraordinary started.’
A background in illustration and 
the visual arts was a key factor in
Laura’s career. ‘After completing an
illustration degree at the University  
of Westminster, I went on to study for
an MA in communication design at
Central St Martin’s. A top advertising
agency then offered me a job, but I
decided to get out of London instead
and set up on my own. I think I always
knew I wouldn’t be someone who would
ﬁt into a particular box, but my career

Laura’s studio-cum-
gallery in Rye provides
the perfect backdrop
for her imaginative 
and colourful designs

path wasn’t necessarily something
I chose – setting up my own company
came about in a very organic way.’
CAREER PATH
Laura’s big break came when she was
approached by Liberty. ‘It was an
amazing opportunity, as I had spent
many a childhood outing in London
in awe of the Liberty building and its
fabrics,’ she explains. 
‘After the meeting  
with the head buyer,  
I wandered around 
London in a daze, 
shocked that they 
actually wanted to  
stock my products.’
Constantly driven  
to ﬁnd new ways of
communicating through
her work, Laura is at her 
happiest and most 
fulﬁlled when creating a piece of art.
‘The idea that what I create gives
pleasure to others is something that
is really important to me,’ she says.
‘Everyone should be able to have
something in their home that makes
them feel good. I also like the idea
that my creations can be passed on
to future generations. That’s why the
manufacturing process is important
to me, too, and one of the main reasons
why my products are made in the UK.
I believe there has to be integrity in
how my work is created.’
Laura lives in a detached bungalow
on Winchelsea beach with her partner,
Jamie, and Pixie the dog. Her home
is also a reﬂection of her unique style.
‘It’s very eclectic,’ she
explains. ‘Most of my
furniture is vintage,
so it’s a real mixture
of styles. As you would
imagine, it’s quite
colourful and there’s art
everywhere. I also have
lots of carefully curated
displays of things –
vintage and antique
textiles, doll’s house
furniture and my
treasured photographs and books –
somehow it all seems to work together.’
THE LAURA OAKES PHILOSOPHY
‘Don’t rush into changing or creating
the look and feel of your home. Let the
spaces speak to you by living with
them ﬁrst and then go from there.’

GET TO KNOW
HER SIGNATURE
STYLE Renowned
for her individual
approach to
interior design,
Laura’s unique style is influenced
by her love of history, nostalgia,
travel and the world around her.
‘I collect books and photographs,
and these are where most of the
images I use in my designs come
from,’ she says. ‘I love anything
that has a history and a story
behind it, so I can’t walk past an
old junk shop without rescuing 
something. I have a particular
interest in Victorian ephemera
– postcards, calling cards, photos,
packaging, fabric and wallpaper,
and have an obsession with
collecting things with an
emotional attachment. I like to
create pieces that are unique, that
have a sense of the past but don’t
feel old-fashioned, so I combine
the vintage imagery I love with a
bold, contemporary colour palette.
A lot of customers tell me a piece
has reminded them of someone
special, or of a significant event in
their lives, which for me is lovely.’

F
rom the outside, Martin Holland
and Mark Walters’ red-brick
semi in Nottingham looks like
the neighbouring houses, but the
inside tells a different story. They
have rearranged the interior
space, knocked down walls and installed their
own striking design innovations, turning an
ordinary house into a uniquely stylish one.
‘While house hunting, we weren’t looking for
a particular type of property,’ says Martin. ‘We
like a lot of different periods and styles, so it
was all about the potential to create something
interesting and individual.’
They viewed several options before spotting
the perfect place – this turn-of-the-century semi
on a quiet street. The house was under offer,
but the sale fell through a few weeks later and
the couple snapped it up. ‘We wanted a project 
➺
and this was ideal,’ says Martin. ‘We could live
in it, but it needed a complete overhaul.’
Apart from the recently refurbished
bathroom, the rooms were bare and the only
original character left was some cornicing in
the hall and living room. The kitchen was damp,
there were mismatched ﬂoors and draughty
windows, and the décor was old-fashioned.
During the weeks it took to secure the
purchase, Martin and Mark ﬁne-tuned their
ideas for transforming their house. Their plans
were ambitious, with a wall-to-wall redesign for
each room. ‘The aim was to create an open-plan
feel with plenty of light,’ says Martin. ‘We like
the blend of classic and contemporary, but
there has to be a quirky edge that you can’t buy
in the shops – and we never do things by halves!’
Once in, the couple demolished the wall
between the living and dining rooms, ripped

out the kitchen and knocked through exterior
walls, ready for glass doors to be ﬁtted in the
dining area and kitchen. Then the patchwork
of concrete, laminate, tile and wood ﬂooring
downstairs was replaced with unifying dark-
stained timber ﬂoorboards. Fitting these
proved to be one of the biggest jobs, involving
taking off all the skirting boards and raising
sections of the ﬂoor to get a consistent level.
‘For about six months, there was brick dust
everywhere and it was dirty, messy and cold,’
recalls Martin. ‘We had a limited budget, so we
did most of the work ourselves with help from
family. It was difﬁcult, but we learnt as much
as we could and focused on the end result.’
Over about three years, the rooms were
replastered, redecorated and rearranged. As the
smallest bedroom was surplus to requirements,

Martin and Mark knocked down the wall
separating it from the landing to form a seating
area, complete with TV and music systems.
They also created unique structural features,
such as the angular suspended ceiling that
houses the kitchen lighting, the integrated
storage and cladding around the living-room
ﬁreplace, and textural wall panelling in the
dining room. ‘The panelling was inspired by
something we spotted in a department store,’
says Martin. ‘Mark designed it using MDF.’ 
One of their most creative ideas is the
double-sided display area in the wall between
the hall and living room. The hall was narrow
and dark, and the couple wanted to increase 
the light, without removing the dividing wall.
Their solution was to knock through a hole and
ﬁll it with shelves. ‘Removing the bricks was

nerve-wracking,’ says Martin. ‘There’s a
concrete lintel supporting the hole, but we
worried that the cornicing might collapse.’
They replaced all the cheap internal pine
doors with timber-framed glass ones,
and glazed doors to the garden from the
dining area and kitchen let in more light. The
white kitchen is offset by richly hued wood
ﬂooring and worksurfaces. The décor, too, lends
the interior a bright yet inviting feel, with
light-reﬂecting chrome accessories and mirrors. 
The newly plastered rooms were painted
white, after which Martin and Mark began
buying key furniture. ‘We’re keen on the neutral
look, so long as it isn’t bland,’ says Martin.
‘We’ve used taupe on two walls in the living
area and the white really lifts it, and we’ve
added texture with cushions, throws and rugs.’
Transforming their home has taken much of
Martin and Mark’s time, energy and money, but
the two have relished the chance to hone their
skills. As a result of the experience, Martin
entered and won BBC Two’s The Great Interior
Design Challenge and he and Mark have since
set up their own company, MartinMark Design
(martinmarkdesign.com). ‘It’s been a huge
learning curve, but we’ve loved it,’ says Martin.
‘And as part of the process, we’ve created the
home we always wanted.’ IH
‘We did most of the work ourselves
with help from family. It was difficult,
but we focused on the end result’

‘We wanted to be able to
appreciate the sea views 
as soon as we stepped 
into our living space’
L
ooking for a change in lifestyle,
Mette Bergmann and her partner,
Jon Lucas, decided to move
from London to the south coast.
‘Jon and I had lived in Shoreham-
by-Sea in West Sussex years
previously and had always talked about moving
back at some point, so when our daughter, Liv,
was just a few months old, we put our London
home on the market and decided to go for it,’
explains Mette. ‘We couldn’t believe our luck
when we found this place right on the beach.
After years of city living, it was the sort of
location we had long dreamed of.’
The three-bedroom house had seen better
days, having been built in the Fifties to replace
properties demolished during the Second World
War. It was covered in cheap plastic cladding,

had a wobbly extension at the rear and had
been poorly maintained, leaving it vulnerable
to the elements. ‘There were numerous leaks
and lots of salt-water damage,’ says Mette.  
‘Also, the front door was at the side of the
house, which wasn’t very welcoming.’ Inside,  
a tired kitchen, grotty bathrooms and multiple
walls that divided up the living areas into 
small spaces needed rethinking.
Despite the negatives, the couple could see
that the property had the potential to be special.
They loved its boxy shape, as it would sit  
well with their ideas for Scandi-style, modern
living. ‘With my Danish roots, I’m drawn to  
the types of houses I grew up with,’ says Mette. 
‘They tend to have simple, clean lines – the
kind of design that suits our personalities  
and the way we live. Jon and I lead busy

lives, so when we come home, we want our
living spaces to be organised, clean and tidy.’
The couple’s idea was to create a beach house
inﬂuenced by modernist architecture. With
only a small budget, they undertook a lot of
the work themselves. Jon started on the basics,
ripping out the old kitchen and clearing out
the space. ‘He was sleeping on a mattress
on the ﬂoor,’ explains Mette. ‘The heating
wasn’t working and the house wasn’t insulated,
so it was freezing. We had two builders living
with us for the ﬁrst six months, but luckily for
me, as Liv was still a baby, I divided my time
between the house and my family in Denmark.
In hindsight, we should’ve lived off site instead
of staying in the house during the works.’
Mette and Jon retained the basic structure
of the building, but changed elements to give it
a more modern, streamlined look. The internal

layout was opened up, the ﬂoor levelled and 
a new kitchen and bathrooms were installed.
‘We had a clear idea of how the house should
look,’ says Mette. ‘Most importantly, we wanted
to be able to appreciate the sea views as soon
as we stepped into our living space.’ This was
to prove difﬁcult, however, as by far the most
challenging task was installing the ﬂoor-to-
ceiling sliding doors on the ground ﬂoor, as
well as the upstairs windows. Made to measure,
the frames were engineered in Germany,  
then shipped over and installed on site. ‘We
mistakenly went with the cheapest quote to ﬁt
them and, consequently, our beautiful bespoke
windows were poorly installed and leaked
constantly,’ says Mette. ‘It took us almost a year
of complaining to get the workmen to sort the
problem, and during that time we lived with
hardboard at the windows to protect us from

the elements, which blocked out the view and
light. When they were ﬁnally ﬁxed and the
boards were taken down, the house was ﬂooded
with light – it was amazing.’
Mette and Jon saved money on furnishing
the interior by shopping online or going direct
to suppliers. ‘Modernist principles are not
very forgiving and are labour intensive, as
such high standards are required to get things
perfect, which often means choosing between
practicality, style and budget,’ explains Mette. 
‘So we salvaged what we could from the
original house, then hunted online for
designer-inspired pieces. Even Liv helped,
painting canvas artworks for the walls.’
Painted white throughout, Mette and Jon’s
home could easily have ended up feeling cold
and unwelcoming, but the clever use of warm, 
‘We couldn’t believe our luck when we found this
place right on the beach. After years of city living,
it was the sort of location we had long dreamed of’
natural materials makes it a cosy and friendly
home. Resisting the urge to use too much
bright colour, they have decorated in a soft
monochrome palette that beautifully reﬂects
the constantly changing seascape beyond the
windows. Occasional bursts of red show these
stormy shades off beautifully. ‘The reason for
all the grey, which is a very Danish colour, is
because it enhances the limited amount of
daylight we have in winter,’ says Mette.
She thinks that this way of life isn’t for
everyone. ‘Living in a house such as this is like
being in a glass box with everything on show
and we’re very exposed to the elements,’ she
says, ‘but we love the breathtaking seascapes
and the fact that we can open up our home to
the beach, so it becomes an extension of our
garden. We feel healthier just being here.’ ➺

K
een to buy their ﬁrst home
together, Siobhan Lam and
Jamie Hughes had been
searching for what seemed
like an eternity to ﬁnd their
ideal place, but when Siobhan
spotted this terraced house in Dublin in 2011,
she knew it was the one. ‘The building was split
into bedsits, and when it came to viewings, the
tenants weren’t very obliging, so I only saw
the upstairs and none of the downstairs, but
I could see the potential,’ says Siobhan. ‘There
was a lot of interest, so I put in an offer there
and then, without Jamie even seeing it.’
Once the couple’s offer had been accepted,
they set about planning the look they wanted to
achieve. ‘We had plenty of time as it took six
months to get the keys to the property, by
which point we knew we wanted an open-plan
layout, with industrial-style exposed brickwork
and ﬂoorboards,’ says Siobhan. To save money,
the couple decided to live in the upstairs bedsit
while they worked on the downstairs.
The house was gutted, rewired and replumbed,
while the ground ﬂoor was opened up and ➺

had a window and French windows ﬁtted to
brighten up the space. A rickety spiral staircase
was removed and the old kitchen was torn out
and replaced with a new one from Ikea.
On a tight budget, the couple decided to
tackle as much of the work as they could
themselves, knocking down walls, pulling down
ceilings and ripping up ﬂoors. ‘Jamie is very
hands on and his father is a carpenter, so he
really helped us and gave us the conﬁdence
to tackle jobs that we would otherwise have
handed over to builders,’ says Siobhan.
With the help of Jamie’s father, the couple
managed to ﬁt a new kitchen themselves.

They stopped short of doing the hard labour
themselves, though: ‘We knew our limitations
and hired a structural engineer to give advice
on load-bearing walls and used builders to put
in the steel supports that were needed in the
living space and kitchen,’ says Siobhan.
Having never done a project like this before,
it was a huge undertaking for the couple, and
doing the work themselves meant it was a
drawn-out process taking nearly two years to
complete. ‘We spent all our free time working
on the house,’ says Siobhan. ‘All our evenings

it was really hard work and we were both
longing for the day when we weren’t covered
in dust and living on a building site, but we
were very motivated and determined to get
the house we wanted, which kept us going.’
Once the downstairs was complete, the
couple started work on the upstairs. ‘We
opened up the bedsit at the front of the house,
which was originally a small kitchen and
living room, and is now my home ofﬁce,’ says
Siobhan. ‘At the back of the house we made
the bathroom bigger by repositioning a wall.’
When it came to furnishing the rooms,
Siobhan plundered local second-hand shops.  
‘I have a magpie’s eye for the quirky and
unusual, and am always picking up bits and
bobs from vintage fairs and charity shops,’ she
says. ‘Most of the furniture here is second-hand
stuff that has been rejuvenated with a lick of
paint. We were also given lots of pieces by
family and friends, which saved us a huge 
amount of money. It’s very satisfying to have
created a stylish home on a shoestring.’
The décor throughout is a mix of white walls,
painted ﬂoorboards, exposed brickwork and
charcoal-grey accents. ‘I wanted a neutral
backdrop so I could introduce bursts of colour
with accessories, which can be updated every
so often,’ says Siobhan, who runs interiors
company April and the Bear (aprilandthebear.
com). ‘It also allowed me to experiment with
murals using washi tape, which makes a great
alternative to wallpaper.’
The hard work has paid off and the couple
now have a totally different house from the
one they bought. ‘It was worth all the late
nights and full-on weekends,’ says Siobhan.
‘There were a few ups and downs, but you have
to keep your eye on the end result and keep
going. There’s still a bit left to do, but I think
renovation projects are never ﬁnished. Let’s
just say, it’s very much a work in progress!’ ➺

W
hen Lucy Stentiford
started searching for
a new family home, top
of her wish list was a
property with plenty of
period features that she
could make her creative mark on. ‘As I walked
through the door of this place, I knew it was the
one,’ she says. ‘The style wasn’t mine, but the
owners had done it very well. It had all these
lovely details, such as chunky radiators and
brass-dolly light switches, and the finish was
very high quality.’ With its original fireplaces,
beautiful cornicing and sash windows, the
house was exactly what Lucy and her husband
Philip were looking for, and the deal was sealed.
Lucy undertook a radical overhaul of the
interior colour scheme, using a palette of grey
shades that has transformed the house, with
all its period features, into a stylish space. ‘I’ve
always loved the colour grey because it has so

was in the kitchen when
the Stentifords bought

many beautiful shades and it looks good  
in changing light and all sorts of different
situations,’ says Lucy. ‘I knew exactly what
tones I wanted to use – I’ve been trained in
design, which gave me the confidence to make
it work – and Philip was totally up for it, too.’
However, before tackling the interior, the 
first thing Lucy did was to make over the
house’s exterior, the lower half of which is 
now painted a cool dove grey, with a steel-grey
front door. ‘There was a big hedge and a
crumbling wall in the front garden,’ Lucy
explains. ‘We had to remove the hedge to fix
the wall, and the neighbours said we’d miss 
the privacy it gave, but the garden looks much
better now you can see the railings.’
Next, the couple decided to smarten up the
front path by laying classic black-and-white
tiles. The effect is sharp and stylish, a look they
have transferred to the back garden, where
they’ve covered the courtyard with bamboo

‘I didn’t want wooden worktops as the ones
we’d had before had rotted, so I asked for 
the existing ones to be covered with zinc’

decking and painted the back wall in a pale
grey shade to reflect light into the space.
In the kitchen, Lucy opted for a modern
country feel with industrial touches, including
zinc-covered worktops. ‘I didn’t want wooden
worksurfaces, as the ones we’d had before had
rotted,’ says Lucy. ‘I asked Ralph Levy from
The Handmade House to cover them with
zinc for me.’ She completed the makeover by
repainting the cupboard doors a grey shade
with green undertones.
In the hallway and reception rooms, the
décor changes dramatically from light and
bright to dark and theatrical, with warm,
thundery greys on the walls, sea-spray white
on the ceilings and colour accents in zesty lime.
Inspiration for the scheme came not from
a colour chart but from a vibrant Kosta Boda
vase she and Philip bought with some money
they were given as a wedding present. ‘I loved

The wardrobe doors
came from an old French
chateau. ‘I didn’t like
them at first, but they’ve
grown on me,’ says
Lucy. The William

used as a highchair for
Lucy when she was a baby

the sharp kick of the lime and felt the grey
tones would contrast well with it,’ she says.
A strong shade was chosen for the living-
room walls. ‘I used Marston and Langinger’s
Peat, which is very matt and earthier than the
Farrow & Ball Down Pipe I used in the hall,’ says
Lucy. Then it was easy to bring accent details 
to the room with accessories, such as the white
stag’s head, a graphic fabric Lucy has stretched
over a large canvas frame and statement
lighting, which is Philip’s design contribution. 
‘His father was an architect and the light fitting
in the middle of the room was a gift from him,’
says Lucy. Two opaque cube lights double  
up as handy tables either side of the sofa and
elegant mid-century furniture, as well as a
striking cowhide rug that Philip brought back
from Australia, complete this individual look.
Upstairs, the ambience changes again, with
two bedrooms, a bathroom and Lucy’s tiny

from £440, Debenhams
office all decorated in paler hues. A Philippe
Starck pendant light inspired the scheme in
the main bedroom. ‘I loved the colour of the
shade – a gentle copper hue,’ says Lucy. ‘It
works well with the white wall paint, which 
has a slightly warm grey tinge to it.’
The shutter wardrobe doors were installed
by the previous owners and had come from
a French chateau. ‘They wanted to take them
when they moved, which I didn’t mind initially,
but then I realised it would be too complicated
to replace them with something decent, so
we kept them and I love them now,’ she says.
Every day Lucy walks Coco, the family’s
cocker spaniel, on the beach where she
photographs the changing colours of the sea
and sky. ‘I kept wondering what to do with all
these images and decided to see if they could
be printed onto silk,’ she says. She spent a year
researching the process, eventually sourcing
a manufacturer and creating some designs that
now grace the lampshades and cushions she
sells under her own label, Slate Grey Sea, all
inspired by those coastal walks and her love of
the colour grey. ‘It feels so good to be able to
say that my home and where I live have truly
inspired my creativity,’ says Lucy.

area of colour in your room, so place
a generous sample of it onto your
board. Including carpet samples will
help you think about texture, too.
2
Add an accent tone
A dramatic contrast or an accent 
just a few tones away from your
base colour? Use your moodboard 
to play with options and layer it
with swatches of fabric, scraps
of wallpaper and paint colour charts.
3
Find the right accessories
These will really set the tone in
your room – go for ones that share
an accent colour and stick to a single
theme. Don’t mix styles, or your
ﬁnished scheme will look messy
rather than effortlessly eclectic.

1
THE 70-20-10 RULE For a
balanced scheme, keep 70% of
the elements (say, walls and ﬂoors)
as one colour, then add 20% in
a second colour (fabrics) and
10% in an accent (accessories).
2
THE PATTERN RULE When
mixing patterns, use large with 
medium or medium with small,
never large with small. Pick prints
that share a colour in common.
3
THE PAINTED BOX RULE
The look of paint changes
according to the time of day and
the light in a room. Paint the inside
of a large box with a tester to create
a miniature ‘room’ and see how the
colour changes within a 3D space.
AND FINALLY… Always add
a surprise. A focal point – whether
it’s a feature wall or a piece of art
– is the short cut to a ‘wow’ room.

BE SEDUCED BY
Winter florals
Country florals might be the mainstay
of fresh spring and summer looks, but
these darker interpretations create 
drama and decadence all year
FOR WHERE TO BUY ITEMS SHOWN,TURN TO PAGE 98
THE RULES
1. PICK THE PERFECT FLORAL  
Look for oversized patterns
on a dark background. Think
traditional, but with a modern
twist: trailing prints in silhouette;
painterly designs in bold colours.
2. MIX A DUSKY PALETTE Make
it cosy by using sultry colours,
such as grey or purple.
3. ADD AN ACCENT COLOUR
Lift the look with a touch of fresh
green, shiny metallic ﬁnishes,
or even a hint of neon colour.
4. BE SELECTIVE Keep it elegant
by limiting ﬂorals to one area –
this could be on walls or fabrics.
5. STRIKE A BALANCE Ensure
you use large areas of block
colour to counteract busy pattern.
G
ive your home a
warm, sumptuous
feel with sultry colour
and statement ﬂower prints.

SUBTLE STATEMENT
Soften the impact of
this large-scale tartan
by choosing a soft
pastel colourway 
Vincent Pink wallpaper, 
£76 per roll, Rydal
collection, Sandberg
WHY WE LOVE THEM One 
of the oldest and best-known
patterns in the world, tartan is
traditionally associated with
Scotland’s ancient Highland
clans, with each family having
its own design. Its history
makes it suited to a traditional
country look, but tartan can 
add colour and interest to any
room, if the mix is right.
WHERE TO USE THEM Ideal
for living and dining rooms,
tartan creates a warm, cosy
ambience and is perfect as an
autumnal update. For a grand,
baronial look, try tartan
wallpaper in the bedroom as a
backdrop for a sumptuous bed
piled high with tartan cushions
and a plaid throw. Softer tones 
create a fresh, modern feel and
work really well in an open-plan
kitchen-diner or living room.
HOW TO USE THEM Upholster 
an armchair as a bold contrast
against a plain sofa, use them
for curtains and cushions in a
neutral scheme, or wallpaper  
a wall as a feature. Tartan looks
good with tweed, stripes and
blocks of colour, but it’s best to
pick out the dominant tone and
use it to tie the scheme together.
HOW TO ACCESSORISE
THEM Create log-cabin chic
with wood and leather furniture,
faux-fur rugs and stag heads,  
or for a more sophisticated feel,
contrast a smart tartan with
white woodwork, streamlined
furniture and natural textures.

THE COMPANY Founded in 1993,
Villa Nova is renowned for its range
of contemporary and versatile fabrics
and wallpapers. Part of The Romo
Group, the brand’s youthful, vibrant
pattens are intermingled with plain and
semi-plain designs, for collections that
are modern, stylish and effortless to
co-ordinate. Look out for playful prints,
distinctive pops of colour and easy-to-
live-with plains, alongside pretty
sheers and statement wallcoverings.
THE NEW COLLECTION A modernist
collection of prints and weaves, Etta
features simple cut-out shapes, ﬂuid 
organic ﬂourishes and assertive marks
in bold solid blocks of colour. Art
Deco-inspired shades, including the
bright tones of Clementine, Verdigris
and Begonia, are teamed with a more
neutral palette of Cedar, Quince and
Onyx. The abstract patterns of Etta and
Issy are also available as wallcoverings,
and will create a striking backdrop to
showcase the range.
WHY WE LOVE IT With its mid-
century-modern-inspired designs and
fresh colour palette, the collection

LOCATION Set in the small, pretty
village of Kingham in Oxfordshire,
this traditional 18th-century inn is
nestled in the heart of the Cotswolds.
ROOMS The award-winning
Daylesford Organic farm team was
tasked with reinventing this property,
and its proprietor and Daylesford
founder Lady Carole Bamford has
spent more than £1 million on the
refurbishment. It’s an investment that
has certainly paid off. The overall
look combines pared-down style with
stripped-back walls and handcrafted
furniture. All 12 rooms are spacious
yet cosy with quality mattresses, pure
linen bed sheets and toiletries from
nearby Bamford Haybarn spa. The
soft colour palette of greys, blues
and taupes makes for a calming feel,
while the chunky wooden furniture
adds a rustic but chic look.
FAMOUS FOR Being dubbed the
poshest pub in Britain. The hotel
restaurant serves organic food from
its own garden and also supports
local suppliers. The hotel was named
Pub of the Year 2015 in the Michelin
Eating out in Pubs guide and placed
in the top 10% of The AA’s 2015 guide.

Skylights above the dining area let in more

installing underﬂoor heating cured the

‘It lets in lots of light and connects the house

Moving from sunny

proved a shock for Lisa and Jonathan
Medard. But they were determined to
turn their new house into a light-ﬁlled
home with a bigger kitchen and an

advice and, with his help, replaced the
tiny extension above the garage with
a ﬁrst-ﬂoor main bedroom and en suite,

A four-bedroom, detached
Fifties house in Hampshire.
WHO LIVESHERE
Sheila and Jon Osborne.
WHAT THEY DID
They created extra living space
above the garage, changed the
roof line, fitted a lead-roofed
porch and added an orangery-
style extension to the living
room at the rear. New timber
windows were fitted throughout
and the exterior brickwork
was covered with acrylic
render and weatherboarding.
WHAT IT COST
Sheila and Jon paid £725,000
for the house in 2005 and
have spent £440,000
remodelling the property,
which is currently worth
around £1.4 million.

W
hen Sheila and Jon
Osborne and their sons
– Jack, now 27, and
George, 25 – returned
to the UK after living
in Dubai, they were
hunting for a family home in Hampshire with
enough space for entertaining. ‘We chose this
house because of the location,’ explains Sheila.
‘We liked the south-facing garden, but the
layout inside didn’t flow well, despite the fact
that it had already been extended to the rear.’
MAKING CHANGES Sheila and Jon
successfully placed a sealed bid for the
detached property in 2005, and lived there
for several years before deciding to employ
architect Paul Gallie of WSW Consultancy
(01252 811011; wswconsultancy.co.uk) to carry
out some improvements. ‘We explained to Paul
that we never really used the separate dining
and living rooms, and that the long, narrow
kitchen at the centre of the house served as

…‘the new
improved
layout. We 
now use the
whole house 
rather than
just some of
the rooms’
a thoroughfare,’ explains Sheila. ‘We weren’t
using the whole house and it felt like there 
was a great deal of wasted space.’
The family spent most of their time in the
central open-plan kitchen area, but hoped  
to reorganise the internal layout so that the
kitchen would face on to the garden. Paul’s
solution was to convert the dining room into 
a TV room, with double doors connecting it 
to an open-plan kitchen, dining and family
room. The existing living room would be
enlarged with a single-storey orangery-style
extension to the rear, incorporating glazed
bifold doors on to the garden and a roof 
lantern to bring in plenty of light from above. 
‘We also wanted to reorganise the layout
upstairs and decided to extend out over the
double garage to make larger bedrooms and
two new en-suite bathrooms,’ says Jon. ‘A tiny
boxroom has been taken out, and when you 
go upstairs now the new roof shape creates a
vaulted ceiling, which gives a real sense of

space. We don’t have any more bedrooms than
before, but all four are well proportioned.’
TRANSFORMING THE OUTSIDE Externally
the property has also been given a major
makeover and is now pretty unrecognisable.
Rendering the brick walls and fixing
maintenance-free composite weatherboarding
at first-floor level, installing sash windows and
constructing an oak-framed porch has created 
a pretty, traditional look. ‘At first, we hadn’t
planned to cover all the external brickwork 
with acrylic render, but Paul recommended it
and we’re so pleased that we went ahead, as the
render and weatherboarding give the house the
New England look we like,’ says Sheila. ‘Details
like the oak posts to the porch and the lead roof
over the front door really help to add character
and bring the whole design together.’
The house is within a conservation area, but
planning permission was quickly granted for
the dramatic changes. Building work was then
undertaken by Charlie Brown of Moseley
Green Bicknell Brown (01420 473162), and 
was completed in August 2013. 
WORK IN PROGRESS During this time, it  
was impossible for Sheila and Jon to live in  
the house, so they decided to stay in their
Spanish holiday home, returning regularly for
progress reports and staying in touch with their
architect and builder on Skype. ‘We trusted our
team and they sent us regular video updates  
of the build,’ says Jon. ‘Everything ran fairly
smoothly, although there was a delay with the
rendering because of the weather, but overall
the project took only four months to complete.’
The roof was retained where possible and
new sections were built in timber and clad 
in tiles, which were sourced to match the 
originals. Foundations were dug for the timber
living-room extension, which was constructed
by a joinery company. A roof lantern was
installed to keep the room light and bright.
Bifold doors lead from the living room and
kitchen on to a terrace, which is perfect for
entertaining. ‘It was a dark and dingy living
room before, but now we spend every evening
in there,’ says Sheila. ‘We’re surrounded by
glass and feel connected to the outdoors, 
which really lifts our mood.
‘Family and friends wondered why we were
making such drastic changes to the house,  
but when they saw the end result they were
completely amazed. We almost moved house 
at one point because the layout wasn’t working,
but now we’re so glad we stayed.’ 
A single-storey
extension has been
added to the rear, and
new windows and
bifold doors installed
Pale-painted units,
highly polished
worktops and a vaulted

■Many alterations can be
made under Permitted
Development, meaning you
don’t need to get planning
permission. For more
information on planning and
building regulations, visit
planningportal.gov.uk and
always check with your
local authority before
making any major changes.
■Keep your neighbours
informed at all stages and
you might need to obtain
party wall agreements,
too. Check the advice given
at planningportal.gov.uk.
■For extensions and major
remodelling, it’s usually
advisable to employ an
architect to draw up accurate
plans: the Royal Institute of
British Architects (architecture.
com) holds a directory
of approved architects.
■Get at least three quotes
for all major purchases,
including when you’re hiring
tradesmen and, whenever
possible, negotiate ﬁxed
prices for each job rather
than paying a daily rate.
■It’s not usually advisable
to undertake major rooﬁng
work on a DIY basis. Go
to the National Federation
of Rooﬁng Contractors’
website (nfrc.co.uk) to ﬁnd a
reputable roofer to do the work.
■Remember to factor
delays into the schedule
and always have a contingency
pot of money to pay for those
unforeseen expenses.
RENOVATION
KNOW-HOW
Adding a roof lantern has totally
transformed Sheila and Jon’s 
living room, which was previously
dark and uninviting. The work 
was carried out by Oakhanger
Joinery (01420 478090;
oakhangerjoinery.com).
■ Roof lanterns differ from roof lights
as they project up from the roof, with
glazed sides bringing in more light
than a flat pane of glass. Lanterns can
be bought off the shelf or made to
order, and can take many forms. They
are ideal for flat roofs and can have
opening elements for ventilation. 
IN DETAIL ROOF LANTERNS
Let light flood in, like the Osbornes did
■ Consider material carefully – timber
has a traditional look but will need to
be treated every few years to keep  
it looking good, while UPVC and
aluminium require less maintenance. 
■ Planning permission is not usually
required for installing new roof
lanterns, as long as they meet the
criteria in the Planning Portal 
(planningportal.gov.uk). 
■ Building regulations will need to 
be met to ensure that the roof is
strong enough to carry the weight  
of the lantern and that the structure is
sufficiently insulated against heat loss.

T
he Aga in the kitchen was all that
remained when Lizzie and Mark
Fenwick renovated their Cornish
cottage. Everything else was stripped
out and the property was given an extensive
makeover to create a comfortable home.
The Fenwicks first spotted the house when
they were enjoying a weekend break in the
coastal town of Fowey and happened to glance
in an estate agent’s window. ‘We both agreed
that it was spectacularly positioned, right
beside the water, and exactly the type of
home we’d love to own,’ explains Lizzie. ‘We
discovered that the sale had just fallen through
that morning, and impulsively submitted an
offer that was accepted the very next day.’
UP FOR A CHALLENGE The house’s décor and
fixtures hadn’t been touched since the Sixties,
and many of the rooms felt dark and made no
connection to the river views. ‘We knew we
were taking on a huge project, especially as we
continued to live in our house in Dorset during
the work,’ explains Lizzie. ‘We employed a
project manager, who orchestrated a team of
craftsmen to gut the interior and, as usual with
old properties, they uncovered lots of problems.’
The rear of the house is built into the hillside
and was extremely damp. The whole side of the

its waterside location’

FEATURE DEBBIE JEFFERY PHOTOGRAPHS SIMON MAXWELL, 
UNIQUE HOME STAYS (UNIQUEHOMESTAYS.COM) PLANS PERSONA-ID 
A balcony across the
width of the cottage
makes the most of
the beautiful views
‘We love the colonial look of the cladding, but living beside
the water means we do get ravaged by the weather, so we
needed to choose robust materials and products’
property had to be tanked and the slate roof
repaired. New wiring and plumbing were
installed throughout, walls were replastered
and the kitchen and bathrooms modernised.
Previously the kitchen was small, and an
internal wall was moved to enlarge this room
by stealing space from the neighbouring living
room, while upstairs the master en suite has
been divided in two to create a new en suite.
CONNECTING WITH OUTSIDE Drawing
additional light into the rooms was a key factor
in the Fenwicks’ plans, and they began by
swapping the grimy secondary double glazing
in the kitchen for hand-made wooden French
windows – enlarging existing openings to 
make the most of the views. A joiner was also
commissioned to create bespoke wooden
frames for the rest of the house to replace the
mishmash of UPVC and aluminium windows.
One of the biggest structural alterations
involved extending the small balcony 
Oiled oak floorboards
were laid in the living
room and a wood-
burning stove was
installed in the  
new fireplace
overlooking the river across the full width of
the cottage. The exterior of the building has
been clad in painted timber weatherboarding,
which transformed the previously austere stone
cottage into a pretty white clapboard house.
‘We love the colonial look of the cladding,
but living beside the water means we do get
ravaged by the weather, so we needed to
choose materials and products robust enough
to withstand a coastal environment,’ says Mark.
Lizzie and Mark purchased the cottage for
£465,000 in 2009 and have spent in excess
of £250,000 renovating the property, which
is currently worth around £950,000 and is
barely recognisable from the original building.
Now sun shines into the well-proportioned
rooms and the décor is understated and
relaxing. ‘For us, there’s nothing better than
sitting out on the terrace in the evenings,’ says
Lizzie. ‘We love listening to the tinkling of boat
masts on the river and never tire of the view.’
Trials &
triumphs…
■What was
the high point?
‘Hunting out
bargains and
seeing the cottage
take shape.’
■Any low points?
‘Finding out that we
needed planning
permission for the
new balcony and
realising we might
have to demolish
the whole structure.’
■Who was the
project saviour?
‘Project manager
Jennie Elderkin was
fantastic, and she
employed a reliable
and honest builder.’

Relaxed dining
With French windows
leading into the garden,
the narrower end of the
room makes the ideal
spot for a dining table
and chairs – the latter
are painted in different
tones of grey to avoid
looking too ‘matched’
S
everal months after moving into
their London town house in 2012,
Sarah and Iain Urquhart decided
that the ground-ﬂoor kitchen and
dining space would be far better in
the basement. ‘Before, you walked 
straight through the front door into the
kitchen, and the room’s high ceilings and huge
windows felt wasted,’ says Sarah. ‘Originally,
there would have been a formal living room
upstairs, with the kitchen down below, but the
living room had been put in the dark basement.
Changing the layout back to the way the house
used to be just felt like the right thing to do.’
At ﬁrst, swapping the rooms seemed a
daunting task, but keeping the original kitchen
intact upstairs while the new one was installed
made it relatively straightforward. Structurally,
the only major jobs that needed to be done 
were to strengthen the chimney breast to make
way for a new range cooker, and to rebuild the
ceiling that was bowing in the middle.
This, however, used up a large chunk of the
couple’s budget. ‘It meant that we weren’t able
to replace the oak ﬂoor, which, while in fairly
good condition, had been laid badly with lots of
gaps,’ Sarah explains. ‘The orange tone would
have clashed with the pale-grey units. But the
kitchen company kindly offered to limewash
the ﬂoorboards free of charge if we covered the
cost of taking them up and reﬁtting them.’
The couple really enjoy entertaining and the
new kitchen is the perfect space for socialising,
with enough room for guests to mingle around
the island. It’s given them an informal dining
area, too, as well as access to the garden from
the kitchen. ‘We’re so glad we did it – it was
worth all the upheaval,’ says Sarah. ➺

DIY makeover  KITCHEN IDEAS
PROMOTION
S
ome people may think that AGA
range cookers are just meant for
big, traditional country houses, but
with the launch of the company’s
new series of models, this is certainly not
the case. Thanks to the marriage of design 
heritage and cutting-edge technology,
there’s now an AGA cooker for everyone. 
Keep costs down
For those who want lower running costs,
the AGA Total Control is the perfect choice. 
Its state-of-the-art touch-screen panel
enables you to switch each of the ovens
and hotplates on and off as you need them,
meaning no energy is wasted and running
costs are from just £5 per week. For the
ultimate in control, opt for the AGA iTotal
Control model, which can be remotely 
operated via your smartphone. If you prefer
a cosy kitchen, the AGA Dual Control has
ovens that are on all the time but, unlike
traditional AGA cookers, you can turn the
hotplates on and off independently of the
ovens, reducing the amount of energy used.
Keep it compact
If you think that your kitchen is far too
small for an AGA, the 60cm-wide City60
is for you. It has two ovens – the top one
can be switched between baking and
roasting modes, while the bottom is for

Old and new
The oven, hob, worktop
and splashback were all
reused. ‘I wanted to keep
as much as possible from
the old kitchen,’ explains
Katie. The tall cupboard
by the door was created
by cladding two tall
basic kitchen units
in distressed plywood
A grand affair
With its chandelier,
white tablecloth and
colonial chairs, the
dining area, provides
an air of faded grandeur.
‘My idea was to mix
rustic utilitarian with
elegance, so when I
found this chandelier
abandoned in a skip,
I realised I’d found the
centrepiece,’ says Katie
W
hen Katie Jay planned
her kitchen the ﬁrst
time round, she gave
plenty of thought to
its contemporary looks.
However, 10 years on, it
had become dated. ‘I’d been itching to change
it for a while,’ she says. ‘Then I saw a photo in
a magazine of a ramshackle kitchen in a log
cabin, which had cabinet doors made from old
timber and open, planked shelves crammed
with crockery. The seed had been sown and it
became a ﬁrm plan after we visited some cosy,
dark-walled restaurants in Bruges, Belgium.’
Redoing the kitchen didn’t mean starting
from scratch. The units were in good condition
and the existing chrome oven, hob, sink and
taps suited the new look, as did the slate ﬂoor
tiles. However, Katie soon realised that, to get
the distressed timber fronts she wanted for the
units, she would have to make them herself.
‘I wanted the kitchen to look as freestanding
as possible, so I clad the units in mismatching
timber,’ she explains. ‘Getting rid of the wall
units and introducing shelves added another
element. Lastly, the dining area got an update
with a traditional chandelier and new chairs.’
And the ﬁnished look? ‘The kitchen makes
a statement and I’ve got the look I wanted,
as well as the feeling I was hoping for,’ says
Katie. ‘With the dark-chocolate walls and soft
lighting, it’s fabulously cosy – and lovingly
rough around the edges.’

60-SECOND TOUR
THE PROPERTY
A four-bedroom house, near
Chesterfield in Derbyshire,
built in the Nineties.
WHO LIVES HERE
Deana and Michael Emerson, with
their daughters, Naimh, 15, and
Caitlin, 13, and their spaniel, Jerry.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple knocked down a brick
summerhouse to create space for
an extension, and added a glazed
roof to maximise light.
THE LOOK
Modern farmhouse, with pale and
dark-grey painted wooden units
and industrial-style elements.
LESSONS LEARNED
Accept that you will go over
budget. It’s the extras that create
added expense, but it’s not worth
skimping on radiators, lights and
taps, as they’ll make the kitchen.
TURN OVER TO FIND OUT HOW
Deana and Michael created their new kitchen
BEFORE
THE LAYOUT The base units have
been arranged in a U-shape around
the central island that doubles as a
breakfast bar. An alcove was created
to make a feature of the range cooker
and the other two walls contain a mix
of tall, base and wall units

White heat
The striking white range
cooker matches the
sleek granite worktops,
but also offers a subtle
contrast with the chalk
grey painted units on
either side. ‘l chanced
upon the green oak lintel
at a wood yard online,’
says Michael. ‘We had
it put above the range
cooker to create a
traditional feature alcove’
All seasons
One side of the island
is used as a breakfast
bar, so Deana can chat
to the family while
cooking. In the winter,
the wood-burning
stove keeps the large
space warm. ‘It gives
an extra-cosy feel to
the room,’ says Deana
D
eana and Michael Emerson
have been transforming
their home in Derbyshire
since they bought it 11 years
ago when their two girls
were young, but had put
off the kitchen renovation until recently. ‘Our
old kitchen wasn’t somewhere we’d all hang
out together,’ says Deana. ‘So when it came to
making our new kitchen work for us, we knew
we would have to extend out into the side
return and garden to create a space with an
adjoining open-plan living area.’
Although the house is just 20 years old, it
was built using reclaimed stone from an old
Shefﬁeld mill. To ensure that the kitchen felt in
keeping with the rest of the house, the couple
opted for traditional-style units. They also
reused the stone and windows from the original
kitchen walls, so the new extension would feel
like it has always been part of the property.
Having waited so long, the couple resolved
not to sacriﬁce anything on their wish list. To
keep costs down, they did some of the work
themselves. Together, they ripped out the old
kitchen, Michael project-managed the build
and did the electrics, and Deana did the tiling.
‘The new kitchen is the heart of our home,’
says Deana. ‘We can be cooking while the girls
are watching TV at the end of the room, or
friends are having a drink at the breakfast bar.
It has transformed how we use our home. There
isn’t a thing that we’d change about it.’ ➺

Perfect fit
Hannah and Pete
restored the original
fireplace in the former
bedroom and found
a shower enclosure
to fit into the alcove
W
hen Hannah and Pete
Philipson bought their
terraced home, they
were happy to sacrifice
one of their four
bedrooms for a bigger
bathroom. ‘The fourth bedroom seemed a long
way from the other upstairs rooms at the end
of a corridor,’ says Hannah. ‘There was a tiny
dated bathroom with a bath and basin, and
a separate loo next door.’ The couple decided
they’d knock the rooms together, stealing space
from the old bathroom for a laundry room, too.
When it came to the design, Hannah’s eye
for detail and creative flair were invaluable.
‘We wanted a timeless feel, as it had to suit
the age of our house,’ she says. ‘I spent a lot  
of time researching Victorian bathrooms,
getting inspiration from magazines and using
Pinterest to narrow down the look.’
As she’d always wanted a freestanding bath,
Hannah splashed out on a beautiful cast-iron
design. To add to the character feel, she sought
out period-style fittings, covered an old chair
in grain sacking and hung up vintage mirrors.
‘The hardest part was finding antique brass
fittings,’ she says. ‘I hunted down the taps and
shower I wanted, but couldn’t find a budget loo
or basin without a chrome flush or plug hole, so
the builders sanded them down, sprayed them
gold and aged them with grate polish. The best
bargain was the £50 vintage Singer sewing-
machine stand. It was damaged, but we restored
it and now it’s a fantastic vanity unit.’ ➺

Susanna and Andreas
Norum Lanz realised
that their top-floor
flat was bursting at
the seams. ‘We didn’t want to move because
we were happy here, so we decided to build
upwards to create a new bedroom with an en
suite,’ says Susanna. ‘The neighbouring houses
on both sides already had roof extensions,
so we knew there was an opportunity for us to
do the same. We wanted to create somewhere
with the look and feel of a luxurious hotel.’
A freestanding bath is the focal point of
the new room and can be glimpsed from the
bedroom. ‘It’s nice to have a conversation with
Andreas while I’m in the bath, rather than being
locked away in another room,’ says Susanna.
The couple used the same wood flooring
throughout the bedroom and en suite to link
the two zones. ‘We also went for Bisazza mosaic
tiles, as I love the way they catch the light,’ says
Susanna. ‘It’s a very inviting space.’

THROW A BONFIRE PARTY
If safety issues have put you off the
idea of a fireworks party in the past,
these are the basics you need to know
for a stress- and problem-free do.
1
BE BONFIRE-SAVVY
Build your bonfire a safe distance 
(at least 18m) from houses, trees,
hedges, fences and sheds. Don’t use
petrol or paraffin to light it – domestic
firelighters are a safer option – and
check for hibernating hedgehogs
first. While a bonfire is a good
opportunity to burn scrap wood or
garden waste, never burn tins of
paint, tyres, batteries, foam-filled
furniture, aerosols or used fireworks. 
2
BUY THE RIGHT FIREWORKS
Make sure you buy fireworks
that are intended for garden use
(Category 2) and look for the British
Standard number BS7114. ‘Garden’
fireworks still require a spectator
distance of at least 5–8m, so if your
plot is smaller than that, go to a
public display instead.
3
PREPARE PROPERLY
Store the fireworks in a metal box
with a lid before and during your
display, and never keep fireworks in
your pocket. Read the instructions for

November
Dig a shallow pit and
surround it with bricks or
large stones (this will stop
the ﬁre from spreading) 
HOW TO BUILD THE PERFECT BONFIRE
Arrange tinder (dry leaves,
grass, bark, and twigs) into
a bundle, then place it in
the centre of the pit 
Build a tepee above it using
kindling sticks of increasing
size. Leave an opening for
the wind to fan the ﬂames
Create a larger tepee
around the kindling using
fuel wood (branches the
width of your forearm)
Light the tinder and fan
if necessary. As the
tepee burns, feed the ﬁre
with more fuel wood
the fireworks before your event, and
then again before lighting each one
– have a torch to hand if necessary.
4
HAVE A DESIGNATED
FIREWORK LIGHTER
Make one person responsible for the
lighting of all fireworks, to keep the
display controlled. Make sure they
don’t drink too much! They should
light fireworks one at a time, using
a taper held at arm’s length. Never
return to a lit firework, or throw them.
5
PRACTISE SAFE SPARKLING
Adults should tell children to hold
sparklers at arm’s length and not run
with them or wave them near anyone.
They should then light them, before
handing them to the children (over-
fives only). Get anyone who wants to 
have a sparkler to wear gloves, and
supply a bucket of water or sand for
putting sparklers in, hot end down,
when they’re spent. Avoid dressing
yourself or your children in flowing
clothes, which could catch light.
6
KNOW WHAT TO DO IN  
AN EMERGENCY
Read up on basic first aid for cooling
and protecting a burn (visit sja.org.
uk), and have emergency numbers 
to hand, just in case.
7
AND FINALLY…
Everyone knows this, but it’s easy
to forget in all the excitement: make
sure you keep pets safe indoors with
all the doors and windows shut, and
curtains or blinds drawn to muffle 
the noise of fireworks.

November SEASONAL IDEAS
NURTURE THE LAWN
Treat it as soon as possible with
a special lawn feed to help the grass
recover after a summer of wear and
tear. Some lawn fertilisers will both
strengthen the roots and kill moss
for a healthier lawn come spring.
Give it one last mow before winter.
Grass continues to grow as long
as the temperature is above 5˚C, so
raise the cut to winter height, around
25% higher than in the summer
months, and mow before frosts arrive.
Rake up fallen leaves throughout
autumn – fallen leaves and debris
can trap moisture, encourage disease
and turn your lawn yellow.
Keep off the grass if it’s frosty 
or wet to prevent damage.
PROTECT PLANTS
Cut back perennials once the
foliage has died back and mulch
around the remaining ‘crown’ with
straw, bark chips or fallen leaves.
Dig up and store tender perennials,
such as dahlias and gladioli, that
won’t survive hard freezes. When
digging, be careful not to damage 
the plant’s tuber or corm.
PREPARE THE GARDEN  
FOR WINTER
Put your garden to bed with some tender loving care and it’ll 
bounce back in spring, whatever the weather throws at it
FEATURE KAREN BRAY PHOTOGRAPHS GAP PHOTOS
Wrap plants in pots in fleece, bubble
wrap or coconut matting – their roots
are more exposed to cold than if they
were planted in the ground. Wrap
the pot itself, and the plant as well if
it’s an exotic or half-hardy, and group
pots together in a sheltered spot
near the house for protection.
Move tender potted plants to a
greenhouse or bring them indoors
before the first frosts. Most will make
the transition from outdoor plant  
to house plant and back again.
TIDY TOOLS AND FURNITURE
Cover garden furniture or move it
under cover. Take outdoor cushions
indoors – they can develop mildew 
if stored in a shed or garage.
Treat hardwood tables and chairs
with a protective oil, such as Ronseal
Garden Furniture Protector, £13.64
for 750ml, B&Q.
Brush and wash plastic, resin and
metal furniture, and protect it with 
a waterproof cover over winter.
Clean and oil the metal parts
of tools to prevent rusting before
putting them away in a shed. Hang
large tools on a rack to save space.
PREPARE FOR THE WEATHER
Check your shed and replace torn
roof felt. Lock the windows and door.
Stock up on salt or grit to scatter
onto icy paths and paving.
Use an oil-based stain on wooden
fences and structures to keep the
wood supple and allow it to ‘breathe’,
so that rain can evaporate without
causing shrinkage or swelling.
Check exterior walls of your house
for cracks and get them fixed as soon
as possible. If water gets in and
freezes, it’ll widen the crack.
Unblock airbricks to allow air to
flow freely beneath your property –
poor ventilation can lead to damp
timbers, which are susceptible to rot. 
CREATE AN
INDOOR GARDEN
A terrarium will give you
greenery all year round
1
PICK A POT Choose an
open terrarium for drought-
loving plants, or a closed one
for moisture-loving varieties.
2
MAKE A BASE Line it with
gravel and aquatic charcoal,
then a layer of potting compost.
3
ARRANGE PLANTS Embed
two or three slow-growing
plants in the compost, not letting
the leaves touch the sides of the
terrarium. Fill gaps with bark chips, 
lichen, moss and stones.
4
WATER SPARINGLY
Mist the leaves and glass to
clean off any soil. Do not seal the
container until the moisture has
evaporated. Make sure an open
terrarium doesn’t totally dry out.
5
TAKE CARE OF IT Place your
terrarium in good light but not
in direct sunlight. If it’s closed, air the
plants every two or three weeks.

November SEASONAL IDEAS
Feeling stressed and overwhelmed by life? Slow down
and regain control with this life-changing technique
Try something new...
Q
WHAT EXACTLY IS IT?
Although mindfulness is the
latest buzzword, it’s actually been
around for thousands of years. Based
on ancient Buddhist meditation
practices and breathing exercises, it is
an awareness of what is taking place
in the present moment. The rise in the
popularity of mindfulness can be put
down to the growing body of evidence
pointing to its health benefits – in the
last 10 years, it has been prescribed
to thousands of NHS patients to help
beat anxiety, depression and stress.
Q
WHY SHOULD I DO IT?
If you find yourself racing from
task to task and feeling frazzled, then
mindfulness could be the answer. The
basic practices are easy to carry out
and can take less than 10 minutes. As
well as helping reduce stress levels, it
offers the opportunity to get to know
yourself better, so you’re less likely
to focus on the negatives and will get
better at dealing with your emotions.  
Q
HOW DO I GET STARTED?
The Headspace app offers a
great introduction to mindfulness with
Take10 – a programme of 10-minute
practices to be carried out every day
for 10 days while you’re trying to form 
the habit of incorporating mindfulness
into your day. No equipment is needed
– simply start by sitting in a quiet,
comfortable place where you won’t be
disturbed. It could be helpful to pick
a certain time of day that you always
practise, as this type of continuity can
help with habit-forming.
Q
WHAT SHOULD I DO?
Breathing exercises are at the
heart of mindfulness. Simply close
your eyes, then take deep breaths
from your belly and focus on the
inhalation and exhalation, noticing the
rise and fall of your chest. Breathe in
slowly for a count of 10, then out for
the same length of time. Repeat this at
least three times. It doesn’t matter if
your mind wanders – some days you’ll
be more distracted than others – just
let the thoughts drift through your
mind, then bring your attention back
to your breathing. Aim to do this for
10 minutes every morning when you
wake up, then for a minute every hour
or so if you can during the day.
Q
CAN I TAKE IT FURTHER?
If you’ve got 10 minutes or longer
to spare, try what’s called body-scan
meditation to become more aware of
your thoughts and sensations. It’s best 
FEATURE HEATHER YOUNG
done lying down – perhaps in bed
at the start or end of the day. Focus
your attention on the top of your head,
then slowly move onto each section of
your body down to your toes, thinking 
about how each part feels. Greater
self-awareness can relieve tension and
encourage peace of mind.
Q
CAN I DO IT WHEN I’M OUT?
Walking meditation is an
excellent way to pay more attention
to the present moment while you’re
on the go. Take a few deep breaths
and make yourself more aware of your
environment and how you’re feeling.
As you walk, focus your thoughts on
your feet hitting the ground and the
swing of your leg as you take a step.
Expand your awareness to what’s around
you, taking in the sights, smells and
noises as you walk. 
Q
WHAT IF I’M TOO BUSY?
If you’re going at a hundred miles
an hour, you can grab any opportunity
to be more mindful. If you’re waiting
in a queue, instead of getting impatient,
slow down your breathing and focus
on it. Identify times of the day when you
tend to zone out, such as when you’re
driving or doing the washing up, and
bring your attention back to what you’re
doing, taking proper notice of the sights,
smells and sounds around you.

necessary. Gently sponge
clean, then rinse. Spot-clean
paper blinds with a damp cloth.  
3
WIPE AWAY DIRT
Close Venetian blinds and
remove dust using a damp cloth
or microﬁbre cleaner, working
from the centre outwards and
the top down. Treat marks and
stains with window cleaner, but
avoid getting wooden blinds
wet as they can warp.

for 30min, or until the flesh is
tender and starting to brown.
2 Meanwhile, fry the red onions
and garlic in the remaining oil
over a low-to-medium heat,
stirring, for 10min, until softened.
Add the chard or spinach, and
breadcrumbs, then fry for a further
5min. Stir in the thyme leaves
and crumbled feta. Add the pine
nuts and season to taste with salt
and freshly ground pepper.
3 When the squash is cooked,
remove from the oven and stuff

Grow something

ACERS
Also called Japanese maples,
these deciduous trees or
shrubs are loved for their
colourful foliage. They come
in either a domed or upright
shape, and vary in size,
reaching from 1.2m to 8m
high, with the smaller
varieties ideal for containers.
HOW TO GROW While acers
suit all types of soil, if it’s clay,
you’ll need to add some organic
matter to aid drainage. You should
plant them in autumn, while
the soil is still warm. Red and
purple-leaved cultivars colour
up best in some sunlight, while
green-leaved varieties can tolerate
full sun, but really all acers do best
in dappled shade. Shelter them
from cold winds and late frosts  
to protect delicate foliage.

PLANT tulip bulbs now, as cooler

to prevent the bulbs rotting.
PICK parsnips after the ﬁrst
frosts, as these will sweeten them
up, but take care not to damage
the roots or they won’t store
well. Leave some in the ground
for further harvests, remembering
to add plenty of mulch. Easy to
grow and care for, they’re ideal
for roasting and putting in stews.

WHY WE LOVE THEM... It’s time to
whack up the central heating, give up
drying our laundry outside and batten
down the hatches for winter, but did
you know having damp clothes and
dry air inside our homes can cause
health issues? The solution is to keep
humidity levels at an optimum of
between 40% and 60%. Low humidity,
which brings on anything from wrinkles
to eczema, can be treated with a
humidifier, whereas high humidity, in
which allergy triggers such as mould 
and mildew can thrive, is tackled with
a dehumidifier. There are also gadgets
that monitor air quality and warn us if
it has reached an unhealthy level.
PRODUCTS WE LOVE… Dyson’s
humidifier uses UV rays to ensure the
light mist it emits is free of bacteria,
while Withings’ home-monitoring
system sends air-quality alerts, so

very least to open a window or even
consider switching to a less-toxic brand.

Master the perfect béchamel – or, at the very least, beans
on toast – with this cool bit of kit. It features an induction
hob, which gives precise control over temperatures, so you
can try cheffy techniques (see page 184), while catalytic

turning grease into fine

FOR GREAT CHRISTMAS
SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS 
Impress your friends and family with delicious, 
home-made, restaurant-standard dishes
Girl About Tech explains…
WHAT IS IT? Blame Heston and
his fellow TV chefs, but the days of
passing off that shop-bought soup or
tzatziki as your own are over. When it
comes to dinner-party food, it’s a case
of ‘go home made or go home’. After
all, if Celebrity MasterChef finalist
Rylan Clark – a man who hadn’t even
cooked ﬁsh before – can turn out an
impressive trio of lavender desserts,
surely you can, too? That’s why it’s
worth adding an appliance or two
to your pre-Christmas shopping list.  
WHAT DO I NEED? Start with
buying an induction hob – you’ll be
in good company as top restaurants,
such as London’s Le Gavroche, are
now kitted out with them as chefs
love their precise heat. If you’re a
keen baker, try an oven with a steam
function for crispy loaves and a
warming drawer with a slow-cook
feature for making meringues and
‘sun-drying’ tomatoes. If you don’t
want to splash too much cash, you
could treat yourself to a slow cooker,
or a pro-blender for creating soups and
cheffy-style emulsions from scratch.

FEATURE AMY CUTMORE ILLUSTRATIONS MONIKA ROE

STEAM YOUR 
WAY TO
BETTER BAKES
If you love baking but ﬁnd it
tricky to get good results, buy an
oven that combines traditional
convection heat with steam. It will
give your bread a crunchier crust,
create moister sponge puddings
and help layers of choux and
ﬁlo pastry to expand into ﬂuffy
clouds of deliciousness.

BE PRECISE
WITH
INDUCTION
Sat Bains, Michel Roux Jr and Nick
Nairn are just some of the top chefs
who have swapped their gas burners
for induction zones. These are much
cheaper to run – a key consideration
in a pro kitchen – and they often come
with a rapid booster function for boiling
water quickly and for sautéing, plus
ultra-low settings for tasks such as
melting chocolate and simmering
sauces, ideal if you’re looking to take
your dishes to the next level.
Tech Tip ‘Like anything
highly temperature-sensitive,
hollandaise is easier to make
on an induction hob as you can
keep the water at exactly the
simmering point you need’

SLOW COOK
FOR TASTE AND
TENDERNESS
Re-create your Gastropub favourites
with that Seventies staple, the
slow cooker. Cooking on a low
heat for a long time (often for
eight hours or more) will turn
cheaper cuts of meat into tender
dishes – experiment with pulled
pork or braised beef cheeks, and
you’ll see what I mean. Countertop
slow cookers have limited capacity,
so you might prefer a range cooker 
or built-in oven with a slow-cook
programme. Top chefs favour warming 
drawers, due to their more precise
temperature controls – even I managed to
make the most delicious Parmesan crisps in one.

LOCK IN
FLAVOUR WITH
SOUS-VIDE
You’ll need to invest in the right kit, but
if you want to impress with the most
succulent steaks and the creamiest
crème brûlées, try sous-vide cooking.
Meaning ‘under vacuum’, sous-vide
involves sealing food in an airtight
bag using a vacuum packer, then
placing it in a steam oven or water
bath to cook. MasterChef 2011 winner
Tim Anderson is a big fan of the
method, which preserves the ﬂavours,
juices, nutrients and textures lost in
conventional cooking. ‘Try carrots – oh
man!’ he says. ‘Chuck them in a vacuum
bag with some butter, brown sugar and
salt. They’ll take much longer to cook than 
usual, but will taste amazing.’
4
INVEST IN A
‘SUPER BLENDER’
These powerful machines
can make the most velvety
emulsions and the
smoothest of soups, and
take on tasks that regular
blenders just can’t handle,
like milling ﬂour and
blending fresh nut butters.
Deliciously Ella says that her

blender I’ve ever used’.

With canvases by famous

lways thought that hanging
wallpaper is a bit of a ﬁddly,
time-consuming job that you’d
rather avoid? You’ll be pleased to hear
the wallpaper experts at Graham &
Brown have come up with a new range
of papers designed to minimise mess
and halve your decorating time.
The wallpapers in the Superfresco
Easy range are made using non-woven
technology, which means you only
need to apply paste to the walls, not
the wallpaper. As there’s no need
to use a pasting table or wait for the
paper to soak, covering walls with
a Superfresco Easy paper is simple  
and fast. Plus, when it’s time for a new
update, Superfresco Easy wallpapers
peel off walls easily and in one strip,
without the need for steamers and
labour-intensive scraping.
With a huge selection of colours,
textures and styles, ranging from bold
geometrics to romantic ﬂorals and
delicate motifs, the Superfresco Easy
range has something to suit everyone.
Ideal Home has teamed up with
Graham & Brown to offer readers
20% off wallpapers in the Superfresco
Easy range for orders made online.
Check out the designs and place
your order at superfrescoeasy.com.

Enjoy the special touch that candles add to your home, but take care to use them safely:
Always place lit candles well away from foliage, furniture, curtains and soft furnishings,
and always out of draughts
Keep candles out of reach of children and pets
 Never leave 
a burning candle unattended
Keep candles away from hair and clothing  
Always place candles upright in suitable holders that can’t easily
fall over
 Always be sure that candles are properly extinguished
BE
CANDLE
SAFE

9 LITTLE LUXURIES
A SUPER-LUXE THROW Laugh in
the face of chilly draughts swathed in
one of these faux-fur numbers from Cox
& Cox. At £195 a pop, you’d better not 
spill hot chocolate on it, though…
DIVA-STYLE WRAP You’ll
shimmy, not walk, around the
house in this silk gown, £210
from Gingerlily. All you need to
go with it is a glass of prosecco
and a pair of maribou-trimmed
mules (no, your Uggs won’t do!)
UPSCALE GIN Who
said gin is best as a
summer drink? Mix
equal parts vermouth
and Hendrick’s, £28
from Waitrose, with
a dash of bitters and
an orange slice for a
great autumn tipple.
Chin-chin!
SLEEK
SPEAKER
Looking more
like a designer
clutch bag
than a slick
speaker, Bang
& Olufsen’s
BeoPlay A2,
£299, streams
your top tracks
to your chill-out
zone of choice
with 360˚ sound
MEGA-GLAM MUGS
When a cuppa just
won’t cut it, treat
yourself to a hot
chocolate served
in one of these
gleaming mugs, £15
each, and stir in some
mini marshmallows
with a glitzy spoon,
from £14 for two,
all from Oliver Bonas
SENSUAL SCENTED CANDLE
Neom’s lavender, jasmine and basil-
scented Tranquility skin treatment candle,
£36 from John Lewis, releases warm
massage oil when lit for extra pampering
CUTE SLIPPERS Cosset your aching
feet with these toasty – yet elegant
– ballerina slippers, £39 at Ruby+Ed.
Less embarrassing than monster-feet
slippers when answering the door, too
POSH CHOCOLATES Originally
created for Claridge’s, these
No1 salted caramels, £14.99
from Artisan du Chocolat,
are definitely not for sharing
THE ULTIMATE BEANBAG
When the sofa just isn’t
loungey enough, sink into
this sheepskin seat, £950,
The White Company. So
squishy, you might need
help getting up again
