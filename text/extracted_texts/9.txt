Residential mobility is defined as the degree to which in-
dividuals change their residence. At the level of individ-
uals, it refers to the number of times they change their 
residence in a given period (e.g., age 5 to 18). At the level 
of the neighborhood, the city, the state, or the country, 
it refers to the percentage of residents who changed their 
residence in a given period (e.g., January 1st, 2020, to 
December 31st, 2020). The change of residence is often 
accompanied by a cascade of changes in neighborhoods, 
schools, social networks, and daily routines. Not sur-
prisingly, the importance of residential mobility has long 
been recognized in behavioral and social sciences, such as 
demography (Clark & Onaka, 1983), sociology (South & 
Crowder, 1998), economics (Hoyt, 1993), political science 
(Squire et al., 1987), and epidemiology (Prothero, 1977). 
By contrast, relatively few researchers in psychology have 
paid attention to the role of residential mobility until 
around 2000 (see Oishi, 2010 for a review). However, over 
the last two decades, psychological research on residen-
tial mobility and relational mobility (the degree to which 
an individual can form new relationships and exit from 
undesirable relationships, Schug et al.,  2010; Yuki & 
Schug, 2020) has proliferated. The present review features 
major psychological studies on residential and relational 
mobilities (see Oishi, Schug, et al., 2015, for an extensive 
earlier review).

Abstract
From ancient time, Homo sapiens moved around in search of a better life. 
Although the development of agriculture and industrialization no longer 
necessitates frequently moving to find new food sources, people today still change 
their residences for a variety of reasons. This article highlights key findings from 
residential mobility, focusing on its implications for the self, social relationships, 
societies, and well-­being. Generally, residential mobility shifts individual 
attention away from collective attributes toward personal attributes. It also 
changes people's relationship styles and preferences, leading individuals to favor 
wider social networks, more open communication, low-­commitment groups, and 
egalitarian helpers. In addition, it increases tolerance for norm violations and 
moral deviations. Lastly, residential mobility can explain some cross-­national 
and within-­nation variations. This article reviews recent psychological research 
on residential mobility and then discusses limitations, paradoxical findings, and 
future directions.

WHY RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY?
First, residential mobility captures one aspect of human 
agency. The anthropologist David Graeber and the ar-
cheologist David Wengrow (2021) argue in their ambi-
tious book “The dawn of everything: A new history of 
humanity” that the history of humanity could be written 
in terms of its creative solutions to the common strug-
gle between individual freedom and social dominance. 
According to Graeber and Wengrow, there are three 
fundamental forms of freedom: the freedom to move, 
the freedom to disobey orders, and the freedom to reor-
ganize social relations. These freedoms are not the prod-
uct of modernity. Since the ancient civilizations such as 
Çatalhӧyűk on the Konya Plain of central Turkey circa 
7400 BC, people have moved seasonally-­even in an ag-
ricultural society-­and have organized their social lives 
differently in different seasons. During a conflict or 
under an oppressive government, people have frequently 
exercised their freedoms to move for a better life. These 
movements have important consequences for individu-
als who move away and those who are left behind alike, 
and the society that absorbs newcomers and for the soci-
ety that loses its residents alike (Carson & Gimpel, 2019; 
Stevenson et al., 2019; Talhelm & Oishi, 2014).
Second, residential mobility illuminates a process un-
derlying some cross-­national differences (Oishi,  2010). 
For instance, one of the most fundamental cultural di-
mensions is individualism–­collectivism (Hofstede, 2001; 
Shavitt et al., 2011; Triandis, 1989). Triandis (1989) spec-
ulated that, in addition to complexity and affluence, resi-
dential mobility is one of the antecedents of individualism. 
Indeed, a recent cross-­cultural study found that countries 
high in relational mobility were also more individualistic 
in terms of Hofstede's score (Thomson et al., 2018).
Despite the long history of human mobility, there are 
enormous diversities in the rate of residential mobility 
across societies and times (see Figure  1). For instance, 
the United States has always been known for its high rate 
of residential mobility since colonial days (Turner, 1921; 
van Minnen & Hilton,  2002). In Sangamon County, 
Illinois, 80% of households living there in 1840 moved 
elsewhere by 1850; in Boston's Jamaica Plain district, half 
of the household heads listed in 1880 were gone by 1890 
(Fischer, 2002). By contrast, Germans are known for res-
idential stability, despite rapid economic growth in the 
post-­World War II period. The rate of residential mobility 
in Germany in the 1980s was equivalent to the rate in the 
1830s (Hochstadt, 1999). Many of the youth who moved 
to the cities for jobs eventually returned to their villages.
These cross-­national differences in the general ten-
dency to move can have a lasting impact on national cul-
ture. For instance, corporate culture in the United States 
has emphasized that future managers and executives are

RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY
transferred to various branch offices in different regions, 
thereby familiarizing themselves with the entire organi-
zation (Whyte Jr., 1957). In 1997, the American retail cor-
poration Wal-­Mart entered the German market through 
the acquisition of Wertkauf with an estimated cost of 
$1.04 billion. In July 2006, however, Wal-­Mart declared 
its defeat in Germany. What happened? Landler and 
Barbaro (2006) reported in the New York Times as fol-
lows: “Compounding the problem, Wal-­Mart shut down 
the headquarters of one of the chains, infuriating em-
ployees who opted to quit rather than move. Such a deci-
sion would have been routine in the United States, where 
Ms. Keck said, ‘moving is a big part of the Wal-­Mart 
culture’. In Germany, she said, it prompted an exodus 
of talented executives.” As such, some cultural clashes 
and differences could be explained in part by differential 
familiarity with residential mobility (Oishi, 2010).
Third, residential mobility can explain within-­country 
changes over time as well as within-­country regional 
variations. Even though the United States as a whole is 
a mobile country, some states are more mobile than oth-
ers (see Figure 2). For instance, Nevada, Arizona, and 
Florida are far more mobile than Pennsylvania and West 
Virginia. U.S. states with higher levels of residential mo-
bility have more loose cultures (fewer strongly enforced 
rules and more tolerance for deviance) than the states 
with lower levels of residential mobility (Harrington & 
Gelfand, 2014). Even within the same country, the rate 
of residential mobility changes over time rather dramat-
ically. In the United States, over 20% of the population 
moved from one year to another in the 1950s. The annual 
rate of mobility in the United States went down to less 
than 10% in 2019. The decrease in the rate of residen-
tial mobility was associated with the decline in optimism 
and generalized trust and the increase in fatigue, anxi-
ety, and tribalism (Buttrick & Oishi, 2021).
Finally, at the level of individuals, some have moved a 
lot while growing up, while others have not. These indi-
vidual differences are associated with how people define 
themselves, how they interact with others, and how they 
make decisions. Likewise, even within the same person, ex-
pecting to stay in one place for a long time versus expecting 
to stay in one place briefly makes a noticeable difference 
in terms of various intrapersonal and interpersonal strate-
gies. In sum, residential mobility captures situational, indi-
vidual, historical, regional, and cross-­national differences 
in the degree to which people change their residence.
PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS 
OF RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY
Implications for the self
Identity
According to the philosopher Charles Taylor (1989), peo-
ple used to have a clear sense of who they are in part 
because their identities were based primarily on perma-
nent attributes such as their family origin, community, 
religion, and social class (see also Baumeister, 1986). In 
a traditional community, the family name was not just a 
“name”; it was a title that could communicate the local 
history, social standing, or prestige of a family. In addi-
tion, people must perform their given social roles (e.g., 
being a son) in such a community. Thus, social roles signal 
important information about a person in a residentially 
stable community. In a residentially mobile community, 
however, there is no longer shared knowledge about most 
families, and group affiliations and social roles are only 
temporal parts of identification, rendering them not use-
ful for identifying those with nomadic lifestyles.
Therefore, residential mobility forces individuals to 
base their identities on their own attributes (e.g., hard-
working and outgoing) more than their family origin, 
groups, and roles. When participants in a study were 
asked to describe who they are using their own words, 
individuals who had moved twice or more while grow-
ing up were more likely to describe who they are in 
terms of personal attributes (e.g., intelligent and ath-
letic) than those who had never moved (Oishi, Lun, & 
Sherman,  2007). Furthermore, 18.48% of those who 
moved twice or more did not use any group affiliations 
in their self-­descriptions, whereas only 4.76% of those 
who never moved did not use any group affiliations in 
their self-­descriptions. Likewise, individuals in a mo-
bile mindset viewed the ability to perform one's role as 
less important than those in a stable mindset did (Chen 
et al.,  2009). Thus, residential mobility seems to shift 
their self-­definition from collective attributes and social 
roles to personal attributes.
As people move, their personal identification and 
place become detached (Easthope, 2009). A longitudinal 
study of young adults found that those who moved more 
than 50 km (31 miles) between assessments had weaker 
local identity (i.e., less strongly identified with the region 
of their residence) than those who stayed. Weaker local 
identity was associated with having a romantic part-
ner, friends, or family members living in far-­away loca-
tions and an increase in geographical distance to close 
others over time (within-­person, Borschel et al.,  2019). 
Residentially mobile individuals' weaker local identity 
is instead replaced with a larger global identity, which 
also leads them to be more likely to donate to a far-­away 
place (Wang et al., 2021).
Internal locus of control
As people move, they seem to place more centrality on 
internal attributes over external attributes. For example, 
relationally mobile individuals (who think it is easy to 
form new relationships and exit from undesirable rela-
tionships) tend to see someone else's actions as a result 
of their personal volition, whereas relationally stable in-
dividuals tend to see someone else's actions as a result of

situational constraints. This suggests that relational mo-
bility is associated with a greater internal locus of con-
trol, while relational stability is associated with a greater 
external locus of control (San Martin et al., 2019).
Furthermore, relational mobility and internal locus 
of control are associated with analytic thinking, whereas 
relational stability and external locus of control are as-
sociated with holistic thinking (San Martin et al., 2019; 
Zhou et al., 2012). Relationally mobile individuals tend 
to be good at cognitive tasks that require focusing on 
the central figure while ignoring the context, whereas 
relationally stable individuals tend to be good at cog-
nitive tasks that require understanding the relationship 
between the central figure and the background.
Familiarity-­seeking
Moving itself is a stressful life event (Holmes & 
Rahe, 1967), and it is accompanied by a host of other 
stressful events such as a change in living conditions, 
schools, neighbors, friends, and affiliations. When 
people are under stress, they like to cling to familiar 
objects. The most famous psychological example is Mary 
Ainsworth's (1979) Strange Situation procedure. In the 
presence of a mother, an infant explores the world, play-
ing with new toys and searching new territory. Once the 
mother leaves the scene, however, the infant freezes, 
cries, and clings to a familiar object (e.g., a teddy bear). 
In a similar way, an adult under threat is soothed by 
holding their partner's hand (Coan et al., 2006).
Extending this logic, Oishi, Miao, et al.  (2012) hy-
pothesized that residential mobility would increase 
familiarity-­seeking. They found that U.S. states with a 
higher rate of residential mobility (e.g., Nevada) have 
more national chain stores such as Target and California 
Pizza Kitchen than states with a lower rate of residential 
mobility (e.g., Pennsylvania). This association held, even 
after controlling for the total population and median in-
come. Second, they found that participants who moved 
more while growing up preferred national chain stores 
(e.g., Starbucks) to local stores to a greater extent than 
those who did not move. In a final series of studies, they 
used Zajonc's (1968) mere-­exposure paradigm, showing 
some Chinese characters more often (familiar Chinese 
characters) than others (unfamiliar Chinese characters).

RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY
Replicating Zajonc, they found that participants, in gen-
eral, liked the familiar Chinese characters more than un-
familiar ones. However, consistent with the hypothesis, 
participants who had imagined their lives after college 
being very mobile showed a stronger familiarity-­liking 
effect than those who had imagined their lives after col-
lege being very stable (see Figure 3).
More recently, an experiment found that participants 
who imagined a residentially mobile lifestyle were more 
likely to pick household products with more traditional 
designs (roughly 10 out of the 15 products), whereas par-
ticipants who imagined a residentially stable lifestyle 
were equally likely to pick household products with novel 
designs and traditional designs (Ito et al., 2019, Study 2). 
In short, residential mobility seems to shift people's pref-
erences to seek familiarity.
Subjective well-­being
A residential move is particularly stressful for children 
because they are most likely to move not of their own 
volition but of others'. A longitudinal study that fol-
lowed over 7000 American adults over 10 years found 
that respondents who had moved frequently during their 
childhood reported lower levels of life satisfaction, lower 
levels of positive affect, and higher levels of negative af-
fect. However, this negative association between child-
hood mobility and adulthood well-­being was moderated 
by extraversion: The association was virtually absent for 
extraverts, but it was strongly negative for introverts. 
Lastly, the residential mobility-­by-­extraversion inter-
action effect on well-­being was explained by the qual-
ity of social relationships (Oishi & Schimmack,  2010). 
In general, respondents who moved a lot in childhood 
had lower levels of social relationship satisfaction than 
those who did not move. The inverse association be-
tween childhood residential mobility and the quality of 
social relationships in adulthood was particularly strong 
among introverts, whereas this association was absent 
among extraverts. In other words, extraverts who moved 
frequently in childhood were still able to build good so-
cial relationships in adulthood and therefore were quite 
happy in adulthood. In contrast, introverts who moved 
frequently in childhood were unable to build quality so-
cial relationships in adulthood and therefore were less 
happy in adulthood.
Most shockingly, the 10-­year follow-­up data showed 
that introverts who had moved a lot in childhood had 
a substantially higher rate of mortality risk (they were 
far more likely to be dead by the 10-­year follow-­up) than 
introverts who had not moved at all. For extraverts, there 
was no association between childhood moves and mor-
tality risk (Oishi & Schimmack, 2010). Consistent with 
the mortality findings, a subsequent study found that 
European American college students who had moved 
frequently in childhood and self-­reported as intro-
verted showed higher levels of cortisol (stress hormone) 
compared to those who had moved frequently in child-
hood but self-­reported as extraverted (Oishi, Krochik, 
et al.,  2012). These findings suggest that extraversion 
serves as a buffer from the potentially negative effects of 
childhood residential mobility.
Residential mobility during development
As seen above, childhood residential mobility has been 
shown to have critical lasting consequences. A meta-­
analysis found that frequent residential mobility in 
childhood, described as moving 8 or more times, was as-
sociated with higher levels of behavioral and emotional 
problems, increased probability of teenage pregnancy, 
earlier onset of drug use, depression in adolescence, 
and reduced continuity of health care (Jellyman & 
Spencer, 2008). It is also associated with a greater num-
ber of adverse childhood experiences, which leads to a 
greater risk of smoking and suicide during adolescence

Residential Mobility and Familiarity-­Liking. Participants in the mobility condition showed a stronger familiarity-­liking effect 
(liking a familiar object more than an unfamiliar one) than those in the control and stability conditions: d = 0.63 in the mobility condition vs. 
d = 0.27 in the control, d = 0.32 in the stability condition for the comparison between the exposure of 3 times and that of 9 times. The figure was 
recreated from the data in Oishi, Miao, et al. (2012) [Colour figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]

(Dong et al.,  2005). In addition to adverse health out-
comes, high childhood residential mobility was associ-
ated with lower socioemotional behavioral functioning, 
even if the move was to a more-­advantaged neighbor-
hood (Mollborn et al., 2018).
Frequently moving during adolescence also has ad-
verse consequences. Adolescence is a critical time for 
development, both physically and socio-­emotionally. 
Moving adds stress, which can impede these critical 
processes. One study examining 3700 first-­year univer-
sity students found that residential mobility in adoles-
cence, but not early childhood, predicted poorer overall 
mental health and poorer academic performance (Li 
et al., 2019a). Frequent moving during adolescence is 
also associated with greater amounts of social anxiety 
and impedes development of fear circuit maturation 
and affective regulation (Hasler et al.,  2020). Young 
adults who moved frequently between ages 10 and 
16 had lower concentrations of brain-­derived neuro-
trophic factor (BDNF), which plays a central role in 
the development of the prefrontal–­amygdala circuit 
during adolescence, and more abnormal amygdala–­
orbitofrontal functional connectivity later on, increas-
ing the risk of social deficits.
In addition to these correlational studies, one study 
was able to show causality by using an experimental 
design to test the effect of residential mobility on be-
havioral and educational outcomes in low-­income 
families (Schmidt et al., 2018). In this study, families 
were randomly assigned to either residential mobility, 
by moving out of public housing into lower-­poverty 
neighborhoods using a rental subsidy voucher, or no 
change in residence. In this sample of over 2800 youth, 
residential mobility caused higher delinquency among 
boys who were 13–­16 during the transition time than 
those in the stability condition. However, residential 
mobility did not increase delinquency among boys who 
were 5–­12 during the transition or among girls (regard-
less of age). A similar pattern emerged for educational 
problems. Thus, these findings suggest that the age at 
the time of a move plays an important role in the poten-
tially adverse effect of the move, and that the age effect 
could be moderated by gender and other factors that 
most likely affect social relationships.
Personality and residential mobility
Childhood moves are driven mainly by parents. Thus, 
there are not many personality differences between 
those who moved a lot and those who did not in child-
hood (Oishi & Schimmack, 2010). By contrast, adult-
hood moves are driven by one's own hopes, fears, and 
desires, and thus should be associated with their per-
sonality. So, who is more likely to move? While de-
mographic variables, such as age, education, marital 
status, and employment status can influence migration 
decisions (Détang-­Dessendre et al.,  2002), personal-
ity traits are also associated with migration behavior. 
In the United States, high openness to experience and 
low agreeableness were related to more residential mo-
bility within and between states, while high extraver-
sion increased within but not between state migration 
(Jokela, 2009). On the global scale, high extraversion 
and neuroticism increased the probability of interna-
tional migration (Silventoinen et al., 2008). Similar pat-
terns occur within Australia (Campbell, 2019), Europe 
(Jokela, 2021; Jokela et al., 2008), and Japan (Yoshino 
& Oshio, 2022).
Personality traits are also associated with reasons 
for moving. Some of the most frequent reasons for 
moving include employment, education, family, hous-
ing, and neighborhood. Openness to experience is as-
sociated with more residential mobility for all reasons 
and is stronger for education and employment reasons 
than for other reasons (e.g., family). Extraversion is 
associated with more residential mobility for neigh-
borhood, housing, and family reasons than for employ-
ment reasons. Individuals high in these dimensions, 
who are outgoing and open-­minded, desire more stim-
ulation in their social and physical environment, and 
therefore are likely to move to areas that suit these 
needs (Jokela, 2014, 2021). Agreeableness is associated 
with less residential mobility, specifically for neigh-
borhood and education reasons. Individuals high in 
agreeableness tend to form stronger bonds with their 
community and therefore are deterred from moving 
away (Jokela, 2021; Jokela et al., 2008). Neuroticism is 
associated with more residential mobility for housing 
and family reasons than for employment and education 
reasons (Jokela, 2021). Individuals high in neuroticism 
tend to be less satisfied with their housing and family 
relationships, which drives them to seek better oppor-
tunities in other locations (Jokela et al., 2008).
A longitudinal study of study abroad students 
(Zimmermann & Neyer,  2013) showed that those who 
chose to study abroad at the beginning of the academic 
year were more extraverted than those who did not. 
Furthermore, those who did study abroad became more 
open to experience, more agreeable, and less neurotic 
at the end of the academic year. Finally, the changes in 
openness to experience and neuroticism were explained 
in part by the changes in supportive social relationships. 
To the extent that study abroad students gained interna-
tional friendships, they became more open and less neu-
rotic over time.
Implications for social interactions
Relationship strategies
Oishi and Schimmack's (2010) findings on the protective 
role of extraversion suggest that extraverts' relationship

RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY
strategies might be particularly adaptive under a resi-
dentially mobile condition. In a stable society, one can 
expect family and friends to be there when one needs 
them. Thus, a relatively small social network could be 
sufficient. In a residentially mobile society, one cannot 
always expect family and friends to be there to help. 
Therefore, it is logical to form a larger social network to 
buffer some of the uncertainty. Indeed, a computer sim-
ulation showed that a broader, weak-­tie strategy is most 
adaptive under a residentially mobile condition, whereas 
a narrower, deeper-­tie strategy is most adaptive under 
a residentially stable condition (Oishi & Kesebir, 2012). 
Furthermore, a survey showed that those who live in a 
residentially mobile zip code were happier if they had 
a wider, weaker-­tie strategy than if they had a narrow, 
deep-­tie strategy; by contrast, in a residentially stable zip 
code where the median household income is low, peo-
ple are happier if they had a narrow, deep-­tie strategy 
than if they had a broader, weak-­tie strategy (Oishi & 
Kesebir, 2012, Study 2).
In another set of studies, residential mobility was as-
sociated with friendship diversification (Lun et al., 2013). 
Specifically, individuals who moved around more while 
growing up tended to have different friends for different 
activities (e.g., a movie friend is different from a study 
friend), whereas individuals who did not move tended 
to engage in different activities with the same group 
of friends if they valued social support in friendship 
(Study 1). The association between residential mobility 
and friendship diversification was also observed using 
a residentially mobile versus stable mindset (Study 2). 
In short, just as investors in a volatile market diversify 
their financial investments, people living in volatile in-
terpersonal markets seem to diversify their friendship 
networks as well.
A series of experiments also showed that participants 
who were led to imagine a life after college in which they 
had to move every other year (a residentially mobile 
mindset condition) were more motivated to expand social 
networks than those who were led to imagine a life after 
college in which they had to stay in one place for 10 years 
(a residentially stable mindset condition) and those who 
described their typical day (the control condition; Oishi 
et al., 2013). These differences in motivation to expand 
social networks were explained by anticipated levels of 
loneliness (Oishi et al., 2013, Study 2). Those in the mo-
bility mindset condition spontaneously mentioned more 
loneliness and sadness than those in the stability and 
control conditions; the more loneliness and sadness they 
anticipated, the more motivated they were to make new 
friends. A recent study, however, found that when people 
are moving to a new location with their family members, 
friends, or romantic partner, they are not as motivated to 
expand their social networks as when they are moving to 
a new location without any close others (Li et al., 2021).
While mobility is associated with motivation to 
expand social networks (Oishi et al.,  2013), it is also 
associated with greater effort to maintain existing rela-
tionships. This is presumably because those living in a 
relationally mobile environment must be worried about 
their partner exiting from the relationship to a greater 
extent than those living in a relationally stable environ-
ment. For example, married respondents living in more 
relationally mobile environments, who have more new 
relationship opportunities, gave gifts to their partner 
more frequently than those living in relationally stable 
environments who have fewer relationship opportunities 
(Komiya et al., 2019, Study 2). Likewise, a large study in 
Turkey also found that married respondents who moved 
from their hometown were more likely to rely heavily on 
their spouse for emotional support than those who still 
lived in their hometown (Yilmaz et al., 2022, Study 1). 
A subsequent study also found that those who moved 
placed more importance on the romantic partner than 
those who did not (Study 2). Overall, residential mobil-
ity seems to accentuate the centrality of existing close 
relationships.
Communication style
When one is new to a town, one needs to get to know 
others who could help them quickly (Whyte Jr., 1957). 
This means a newcomer must be friendly and outgoing 
to attract others. Individuals who perceive their envi-
ronments to be relationally mobile are more willing to 
share their thoughts and opinions than those who per-
ceive their environments to be relationally stable (Schug 
et al.,  2010). Furthermore, the more self-­disclosure to 
strangers, the easier it becomes to form intimate rela-
tionships (Yamada et al., 2015).
In a residentially mobile context, an individual's emo-
tions and emotional expression become a central cue in 
interpersonal communication, as other information (e.g., 
family name) is less informative. It is then reasonable that 
individuals in a mobile context pay more attention to and 
are better at coding others' facial expressions. For example, 
individuals who have moved around more frequently were 
quicker to detect the disappearance of a smile in a change 
detection task than individuals who had not moved (Ishii 
et al.,  2020, Study 1). Replicating the individual differ-
ence findings, participants who were led to think about a 
mobile life in the future detected the disappearance of a 
smile more quickly than those randomly assigned to the 
residentially stable condition (Ishii et al., 2020, Study 2). 
These findings show the centrality of positive emotional 
expression in residentially mobile contexts.
Compensation vs. apology
When an interpersonal conflict arises, the offender 
typically apologizes and/or compensates if some dam-
age was done. These reconciliatory behaviors facilitate

forgiveness and the maintenance of social relationships 
(McCullough et al., 2014; Ohtsubo & Watanabe, 2009). 
In a residentially mobile context, it seems logical to get 
compensation for certain right away, since it is not clear 
whether the individual will have a long-­term relationship 
with the offender in the future. In a residentially stable 
context, in contrast, there is a good chance that the of-
fended individual will have a long-­term relationship with 
the offender. Thus, even if the offended party does not 
get compensated immediately, there will likely be other 
opportunities to be compensated in other ways. A recent 
study found that individuals who had moved around 
while growing up preferred immediate compensation 
more than individuals who had never moved (Komiya 
et al., 2020). In contrast, residential mobility did not af-
fect the preference for an apology.
Preferred groups
Newcomers with no prior acquaintance in a town like 
to join groups to make new friends. Whyte Jr.  (1957) 
famously observed that “the transients' defense against 
rootlessness, as we have noted, is to get involved in 
meaningful activity; at the same time, however, like the 
seasoned shipboard traveler, the wisest transients don't 
get too involved” (p. 403). The key is to keep the delicate 
balance of getting involved in a group, but not too much.
What kinds of groups or organizations? Not all 
groups are equally attractive to transients. Ideally, the 
group is easy to join and easy to leave. In terms of reli-
gious organizations, megachurches (more than 2000 at-
tendees at a weekend service) fit the bill. They are easy 
to join because they usually do not have a certain period 
of tentative membership that traditional churches typ-
ically have. Indeed, megachurches have proliferated in 
the U.S. states where there are a lot of newcomers (e.g., 
Georgia and Texas) but not in the low mobility states 
such as Pennsylvania and West Virginia (Oishi, Talhelm, 
et al., 2015, Study 1; see Figure 4). By contrast, there are 
more traditional Protestant churches in less residentially 
mobile states than in more mobile states, controlling for 
the total population and the median income (r = −0.48, 
p < 0.001). Thus, low-­commitment religious organiza-
tions proliferated in residentially mobile states, while 
high-­commitment religious organizations were more 
prevalent in residentially stable states. A follow-­up study 
also found that individuals who moved frequently while 
growing up joined low-­commitment student groups 
more than those who never moved (Oishi, Talhelm, 
et al., 2015, Study 4). Likewise, data from a large internet 
service provider in Japan found that residents of residen-
tially mobile areas were more likely than those living in 
residentially stable areas to prefer a low-­commitment, 
short-­term plan over a high-­commitment, long-­term 
plan (Oishi, Talhelm, et al., 2015, Study 3).
Preferred people
Just as highly mobile people have preferences for certain 
groups, they also have preferences for certain individu-
als. In a series of studies, participants were asked to in-
dicate which of the two individuals they liked better: an 
individual who helped a classmate as well as a best friend 
(egalitarian helper) or an individual who refused to help 
a classmate but spent extra time helping a best friend 
(loyal helper). Participants who moved around while 
growing up were more likely to choose the egalitarian 
helper over the loyal helper. In contrast, participants who 
did not move were equally likely to choose the egalitar-
ian helper and the loyal helper (Lun et al., 2012, Studies 
1 and 2). Moreover, participants who were led to think 
about visiting and staying in a certain city temporarily

liked the egalitarian helper better than the loyal helper, 
whereas participants who were led to think about living 
permanently in a certain city liked the egalitarian and 
the loyal helpers equally (Lun et al., 2012, Study 3).
Likewise, relationally mobile individuals seem to re-
ward honesty more than relationally stable individuals. 
For example, in a reward allocation task, individuals in 
the mobility condition gave an honest stranger more mon-
etary rewards, than those in the stability condition did 
(Wang et al., 2011; Wang & Leung, 2010). The flip side of 
this is that mobile individuals seem to punish dishonesty 
more than relationally stable individuals. That is, mobile 
individuals seem to be more sensitive to honesty vs. dis-
honesty than stable individuals are. Specifically, partic-
ipants who perceived their career to be mobile excluded 
a dishonest partner more aggressively in an experimen-
tal game of Cyberball than those who perceived their 
career will be stable (Whitson et al., 2015, Experiment 
2). Additionally, in relationally mobile contexts, people 
did not pay much attention to enemies, perhaps because 
they can avoid them. By contrast, in relationally stable 
contexts, where people cannot avoid enemies, people pay 
more attention to them, literally, as measured by an eye-­
tracker (Li et al., 2018). That is, mobile individuals ap-
pear to be more motivated to curate the social networks 
filled with egalitarian helpers and honest individuals, 
and actively distance themselves from enemies, unhelp-
ful or dishonest individuals to a greater degree than res-
identially stable individuals.
Weaker in-­group favoritism
In-­group favoritism is one of the fundamental social 
psychological insights (Tajfel et al., 1971). By age 6, chil-
dren are more likely to punish out-­group members who 
show selfishness than in-­group members in an artificial 
minimal-­group situation (Jordan et al., 2014). Thus, in-­
group favoritism is considered part of human nature. 
Yet, residential mobility seems to weaken in-­group fa-
voritism by blurring the boundary between in-­group and 
out-­group members. For instance, a large survey study in 
Iceland found that Icelanders with a personal history of 
residential mobility showed more tolerance toward im-
migrants than Icelanders who had never moved before 
(Bjarnason et al.,  2020). The association between resi-
dential mobility and tolerance toward immigrants held 
significant, controlling for age, gender, education, em-
ployment status, income, and generalized trust.
Furthermore, when participants were randomly as-
signed to imagine living in a country where people 
change their jobs frequently (the mobility condition), 
they rewarded a friend and a stranger equally, and 
punished a friend slightly less than a stranger. On the 
other hand, those assigned to imagine living in a coun-
try where people do not change their jobs often (the sta-
bility condition) differentiated between their friend and 
a stranger: they punished a stranger a lot more than a 
friend and rewarded a friend a lot more than a stranger 
(Wang et al., 2011, Experiment 3).
A recent experiment also found the typical in-­group fa-
voritism in a helping situation among participants exper-
imentally induced to hold a residentially stable mindset 
(expected to live in the same city for a long time), but no 
sign of in-­group favoritism among those who were induced 
to hold a mobile mindset (Li et al., 2019b, Study 1). That is, 
those who thought they would be living in the same place 
for a long time were far more willing to help someone in 
the same department (in-­group) than someone in another 
department (out-­group). By contrast, those who thought 
they would be living in a different city every other year 
were willing to help someone in another department as 
much as someone in the same department. In a subsequent 
study that utilized the Dictator Game (Study 2), partic-
ipants in the residentially stable condition offered more 
money to the in-­group member than the out-­group mem-
ber. By contrast, participants randomly assigned to the 
residentially mobile condition offered virtually the same 
amount of money to the in-­group and out-­group member.
A recent study extended these findings to racial in-­
group bias in perceived pain ratings (Xu et al.,  2021). 
Chinese participants in the residential stability mindset 
condition perceived more intense pain in Asian faces 
(racial in-­group) relative to Caucasian faces (racial out-­
group), whereas participants in the residential mobil-
ity mindset condition did not show racial in-­group bias 
(Study 1). Moreover, a psychophysiology study showed 
that N1 amplitudes (an indicator of early, selective visual 
attention) increased and P3 amplitudes (an indicator of 
task demand) decreased to a greater extent when look-
ing at racial in-­group faces than out-­group faces among 
participants in the residential stability condition; no such 
differences were observed in the residential mobility con-
dition (Study 2). Finally, transcranial direct current stim-
ulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex increased 
the racial in-­group bias in pain perceptions among par-
ticipants in the stability condition but not in the mobility 
condition (Study 3). Using psychophysiological measures 
that are not susceptible to impression management and 
socially desirable responses, these studies show that the 
residential mobility mindset decreases racial in-­group 
bias in pain perception. That is, residential mobility ap-
pears to blur racial group boundaries in pain perception, 
whereas residential stability appears to intensify the de-
marcation between in-­group and out-­group members.
Implications for community
Social norms
Residential mobility has many implications for the role 
of social norms as well. For example, residential mobil-
ity is positively associated with cultural looseness, where

OISHI and TSANG
there are fewer strongly enforced norms and greater 
tolerance for deviance (Harrington & Gelfand,  2014). 
This finding also holds at the individual level. One study 
conducted in China examined attitudes about norms 
in various residentially mobile settings. Across five 
studies, the researchers found that residentially mobile 
individuals—­those that were either living in a temporary 
residence, were in a residentially mobile mindset in a 
laboratory, or grew up moving around more—­were more 
tolerant of social norm violations (Luo et al., 2020). This 
pathway was found to be linked by perceived threats to 
reputation. In a residentially stable setting, individuals 
are more concerned about damage to their reputation 
and find deviant behavior more costly. Therefore, they 
are more likely to view norm violations as inappropriate. 
Conversely, residentially mobile individuals do not face 
the same damage to their reputation and are more likely 
to view norm violations as tolerable.
This reactance to social norm violations can also be 
observed on a neural level as well. A psychophysiologi-
cal study using EEG showed that the N400 component, 
the neural marker for detecting social norm violations, 
reacted more strongly to minor social norm violations 
among participants in the residentially stable mindset 
condition than those in the residentially mobile mind-
set condition (Luo et al., 2019). In other words, residen-
tial mobility reduced the brain's reaction to social norm 
violations.
Moral deviations
If residential mobility is associated with tolerance for 
minor social norm violations, then it is not surprising 
that it is also associated with criminal activities (Haynie 
& South, 2005). As previously mentioned, residential mo-
bility leads individuals to favor weak ties and decreases 
in-­group commitment. Therefore, residentially mobile 
individuals are more likely to act out of self-­interest. One 
study found that a residential mobility mindset manipu-
lation increased bribe-­giving intention in bribery sce-
narios and that this effect was mediated by self-­interest 
(Chen et al., 2021, Study 1–­2). Additionally, a residential 
mobility mindset led individuals to display more actual 
bribing during a behavioral game (Study 3). Another 
study showed that individuals who moved around while 
growing up were more likely to cheat on a knowledge 
test than those who never moved (Zuo et al., 2018, Study 
1). A subsequent experiment showed that the residen-
tial mobility mindset manipulation increased the likeli-
hood of cheating to gain more monetary rewards (Zuo 
et al., 2018, Study 2).
Likewise, if residentially mobile individuals do not 
care about reputational damage as much as residentially 
stable individuals (Luo et al.,  2020), social monitoring 
should not function as deterrence of crime for residen-
tially mobile individuals. Su et al. (2016, Study 1) used 
the number of journalists as a proxy for social moni-
toring and found that residentially mobile cities had a 
higher rate of violent crime than residentially stable cit-
ies, but this association was moderated by the number 
of journalists. Consistent with their hypothesis, among 
residentially stable U.S. cities, the more journalists in 
the city, the lower the crime rate was. In other words, 
among stable U.S. cities, social monitoring had a crime-­
deterring effect. Among residentially mobile U.S. cities, 
however, more journalists did not deter crime.
In a follow-­up laboratory experiment, social monitor-
ing was manipulated using the presence or absence of 
CCTV. In the task, participants could potentially cheat 
to get more money. Relational mobility was measured 
prior to the laboratory experiment. As predicted, partic-
ipants low in relational mobility cheated less under the 
social monitoring condition than under no monitoring 
condition. In contrast, participants high in relational 
mobility cheated at a similar level regardless of social 
monitoring. Thus, individuals with stable social net-
works seem to rely more on social monitoring to guide 
their moral behaviors, whereas individuals with mobile 
social networks seem to rely more on themselves to guide 
their moral behaviors.
Conditional investment in community
A series of studies also showed that residents of a resi-
dentially mobile community are less likely to engage in 
pro-­community actions than those in a residentially sta-
ble community (Oishi, Rothman, et al.,  2007). For ex-
ample, residents of the Minneapolis-­St Paul area were 
more likely to have purchased a critical habitat car li-
cense plate, which charges an extra fee to support the 
critical habitat in Minnesota, than a regular license plate 
if they lived in a residentially stable zip code area than 
in a mobile zip code area (Study 1). Furthermore, the 
Major League Baseball home game attendance records 
showed that residents of residentially stable cities (e.g., 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh) attended home games re-
gardless of the team's performance, whereas residents 
of mobile cities (e.g., Houston and Atlanta) attended 
the game only when the team was doing well (Study 
2). A follow-­up study in Japan using Nippon Baseball 
League's home game attendance data replicated the U.S. 
findings (Oishi et al.,  2009). Finally, participants who 
were assigned to a mobile group were less likely to help 
another group member who asked for help than those 
randomly assigned to a stable group (Oishi, Rothman, 
et al.,  2007 Study 3). In general, residentially mobile 
individuals tended to identify with a particular group 
when it was portrayed positively (e.g., the University of 
Virginia is the best public university in the United States) 
more than when it was portrayed less positively (e.g., the 
University of Virginia is no longer the best public univer-
sity in the United States). Such conditional identification

RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY
is problematic when it comes to collective problems such 
as power outages and climate change, because uncondi-
tional identification is required to tackle collective, long-­
term problems.
Implications for culture
As summarized above, situational, individual, and re-
gional variations in residential mobility have numerous 
implications for the self and identity, moral behaviors, 
cognitive tendencies, interpersonal relationships, inter-
group relationships, and community involvement. In 
addition, recent studies found that some cross-­national 
differences in psychological outputs are due in part to 
the differences in residential or relational mobilities.
Emotion expressions
Residential mobility explains some of the cultural dif-
ferences in emotion expression. For instance, some cul-
tures (e.g., the United States, Australia, Canada) are 
very explicit in terms of emotional expression, while 
others are not (e.g., Japan, Germany, and Russia). In 
a residentially stable and homogeneous context, an ex-
plicit mode of communication is not always necessary, 
as an implicit code of conduct sufficiently provides con-
crete guidelines as to what is acceptable and what is not. 
By contrast, in a residentially mobile and heterogeneous 
context, there is less of a shared implicit code of con-
duct. Therefore, more direct communication is needed 
in a mobile society where there is not much shared 
background knowledge. In one study, participants in 
32 countries were asked to indicate the degree to which 
expressing anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, 
sadness, and surprise in public and private is appropri-
ate (Rychlowska et al., 2015, Study 1). Those living in 
residentially mobile countries were far more likely to 
say that it is appropriate to express those emotions both 
in public and in private than people living in residen-
tially stable countries. In the second study, participants 
in nine countries rated possible reasons for people to 
smile. Participants in residentially mobile countries 
were more likely to say that social bonding (wanting to 
be a friend) was the main reason for smiling than those 
in residentially stable countries.
Similarly, within the United States, residents of states 
higher in residential mobility expressed their positive 
emotions more explicitly in their Facebook pages than 
those living in the states lower in residential mobility 
(Liu et al., 2018). When one is interacting with the same 
group of individuals, one can rely on an implicit mode of 
communication such as tone and gesture. By contrast, 
when one is interacting with individuals from different 
backgrounds, one must be very direct and explicit in 
their communication.
Self-­disclosure
Relational mobility can explain cultural differences 
in self-­disclosure. Generally, Americans are far more 
willing than Japanese to disclose about themselves to 
strangers (Schug et al., 2010). Americans perceive more 
opportunities to form new relationships and greater 
ease in exiting undesirable relationships than Japanese. 
The more relational mobility participants perceived in 
their environment, the more self-­disclosing they were. 
This relationship was mediated by a desire to strengthen 
personal relationships. In relationally mobile societies, 
people can exit relationships at a lower cost. Therefore, 
people are more motivated to signal their desire to 
maintain or strengthen relationships and do so with 
self-­disclosure. More recently, a large cross-­national 
study found that people living in societies with higher 
relational mobility self-­disclose and seek social support 
more than those living in societies with lower relational 
mobility (Thomson et al., 2018).
Generalized trust
Cultural differences in generalized trust can be ex-
plained in part by relational mobility. For instance, 
Americans are far more trusting of strangers than 
Japanese are (Yamagishi & Yamagishi, 1994). In gen-
eral, the United States is much more residentially mo-
bile than Japan. A computer simulation study found 
that as the rate of residential mobility increases from 
10% to 90% of a population, the level of trust to-
ward strangers increased monotonically (Macy & 
Sato, 2002). The researchers suggest that in low mobil-
ity areas, people are familiar with each other and trust 
friends, but rarely encounter strangers and are there-
fore distrustful toward them. However, in moderately 
mobile areas, people are more practiced at reading 
character, and can therefore have more trust in others. 
Thomson et al.’s (2018) cross-­national study empirically 
showed that participants living in societies with higher 
relational mobility (e.g., Brazil and Canada) showed a 
greater degree of generalized trust than those living in 
societies with lower relational mobility (e.g., Hungary 
and Hong Kong).
Friendships
Mobility also plays a role in how different cultures view 
friendships. A classic MIT dorm study found that peo-
ple tend to become friends with someone who happened 
to live close by (Festinger et al., 1950). In a residentially 
and relationally mobile context, however, people can 
make friends with others who share similar interests 
and values outside the dorm. Thus, friends tend to share 
similar interests and values in the United States (Byrne 
 15327663, 2022, 3, Downloaded from https://myscp.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jcpy.1310 by Test, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2025].

OISHI and TSANG
et al., 1967). This is called the similarity-­attraction effect. 
In Japan, however, friends tend to be determined by pro-
pinquity and other chance factors (which courses they 
happen to take), and therefore there is little similarity-­
attraction effect (Heine & Renshaw, 2002). A follow-­up 
study explicitly measured relational mobility and showed 
that the United States–­Japan difference in the similarity-­
attraction effect was indeed mediated by cultural differ-
ences in relational mobility (Schug et al., 2009). That is, 
to the extent that Americans see greater opportunities 
to form new relationships, they seek someone who share 
the same values and interests. By contrast, to the extent 
that Japanese do not see much opportunity to form new 
relationships, they stay friends with someone they got to 
know by chance.
Relational mobility also affects the degree to which 
people are cautious about others (Li et al., 2015). In areas 
with high relational mobility, people have a greater sense 
of freedom to form new relationships and exit undesir-
able relationships. Because there is an exit option, people 
are not afraid of expanding their social networks. Indeed, 
Americans have very positive views of friendships, asso-
ciating friendships with such positive words as trust and 
respect (Adams & Plaut, 2003). By contrast, in Ghana, 
where people do not move around often, it is very diffi-
cult to end undesirable friendships. Thus, Ghanaians are 
quite cautious about friendships, associating friendship 
with ambivalence and guardedness (e.g., caution and 
accusation). Findings about enemyship show mirrored 
patterns. People from low mobility areas, such as Hong 
Kong and West Africa, are very concerned about enemy-
ship because once they make an enemy, it is very hard to 
escape. In contrast, people from high mobility areas such 
as the United States think that an enemy is not a big deal; 
one just has to avoid them.
Given a greater degree of self-­disclosure and simi-
larity in relationally mobile contexts, it is understand-
able that people who live in a relationally mobile society 
(Canada) report more intense intimacy toward their 
friends than those in a relationally stable society (Japan; 
Yamada et al., 2015). The cultural differences in intimacy 
were explained by the degree to which people perceived 
freedom to form new relationships and exit from existing 
relationships.
Subjective well-­being
Cultural differences in relational mobility can also ex-
plain differences in sources of subjective well-­being. For 
example, previous cross-­cultural studies have found that 
self-­esteem is more strongly associated with life satis-
faction in individualistic countries than in collectivist 
countries (Diener & Diener,  1995). Interestingly, this 
connection is moderated by relational mobility. In mobile 
societies, relationships are “competitive” because they 
are determined by choice, and most people will want to 
associate with desirable people. This means that they in 
turn must also be desirable to be chosen. In this competi-
tive market, having high self-­esteem or a high desirabil-
ity would result in more connections with valued others, 
leading to greater happiness. In a less relationally mobile 
society, the social relationships market is not as competi-
tive, and therefore self-­esteem should not play as much 
of a role in happiness. As predicted, Americans perceive 
their environment to be more relationally mobile than 
Japanese, and Americans also based their life satisfac-
tion judgments more on self-­esteem than did Japanese. 
Furthermore, even within Japan, citizens who live in 
prefectures with higher levels of residential/relational 
mobility base their life satisfaction judgments more on 
self-­esteem than those living in lower levels of mobility 
(Yuki et al., 2013).
Similarly, residential mobility affects the type of trust 
that is functional for relationships. For instance, a large 
recent study in China (N  =  10,968 from 28 provinces) 
found that in residentially mobile provinces, trust toward 
strangers was associated with lower levels of depression 
to a greater extent than in residentially stable provinces 
(Wang & Li, 2020). By contrast, in residentially stable 
provinces, trust toward well-­known others, such as 
neighbors and colleagues, was associated with lower lev-
els of depression to a greater extent than in mobile prov-
inces. In short, trust toward strangers was associated 
with better well-­being in residentially mobile provinces, 
whereas trust toward neighbors and colleagues was as-
sociated with better well-­being in residentially stable 
provinces. This is perhaps because, in residentially stable 
communities, people can get help mostly from their close 
others. Thus, those who cannot trust their neighbors and 
colleagues will suffer more during hardship. These find-
ings indicate that residential mobility at the level of the 
city or providence could shape the type of well-­being, 
whether it is based on self-­esteem and trust of strangers 
or on bonding with in-­group members.
SUMMARY AND 
FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In sum, psychological research has shown that residen-
tial and relational mobilities play an important role in 
the self and identity, interpersonal strategies and re-
lationships, group affiliations, in-­group vs. out-­group 
distinctions, social norms, morality, well-­being, and 
pro-­community and antisocial behaviors. In general, 
residential mobility appears to shift an individual's 
focus away from collective attributes and social roles 
to personal attributes and from collective well-­being to 
personal well-­being. It also weakens the in-­group/out-­
group distinction, pushing individuals to prefer egali-
tarian helpers and low-­commitment groups rather than 
loyal helpers and high-­commitment groups. Recent re-
search has also revealed that some of the cross-­nation or

RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY
within-­nation variations could be explained in part by 
relational mobility (see Yuki & Schug, 2020 for a recent 
review, Figure 5).
Divergent findings across different 
levels of analysis
While there are many pieces of converging evidence at 
multiple levels of analysis (Li et al., 2019b; Oishi, Miao, 
et al.,  2012), there has been some divergent evidence 
across different levels of analysis. For instance, at the 
individual level, residential mobility is consistently as-
sociated with lower levels of well-­being (Jellyman & 
Spencer, 2008; Oishi & Schimmack, 2010). By contrast, 
residential mobility at the level of the city has been as-
sociated with higher levels of well-­being (Oishi, Saeki, 
& Axt,  2015). That is, while individuals who moved a 
lot in childhood tend to be less satisfied with their lives 
than those who did not move, those currently living in a 
residentially mobile city report higher levels of life sat-
isfaction than those living in a residentially stable city. 
This suggests that residential mobility captures different 
kinds of experiences at different levels of analysis. At the 
level of individuals, residential mobility, particularly in 
childhood, might capture cumulative stress, whereas res-
idential mobility at the level of the community might sig-
nal opportunities and economic growth. It is important 
to explore the differential roles of residential mobility at 
multiple levels of analysis in conjunction in the future.
Similarly, there are also some inconsistent or paradox-
ical findings that require further interpretation and the-
orizing. Several previous papers found that residential 
and relational mobilities are positively associated with 
generalized trust (e.g., Macy & Sato,  2002; Thomson 
et al., 2018). By contrast, recent studies in China showed 
the opposite pattern: Residential mobility was associated 
with lower levels of trust (Zhao et al., 2021). Specifically, 
Chinese participants who moved more often reported 
lower levels of interpersonal trust than those who did 
not. It is important to explore potential moderators of 
these divergent findings in the future.
Another paradoxical finding emerges in research re-
garding life satisfaction and crime. Some research has 
shown that at the state (Talhelm & Oishi,  2014) and 
city (Oishi, Talhelm et al., 2015) levels, and residential 
mobility is positively associated with life satisfaction. 
However, at the neighborhood level, residential mobility 
erodes collective efficacy (Sampson et al., 1997), which 
leads to more crime. In addition to the paradox of happi-
ness and crime, the link between residential mobility and 
criminal behavior could vary depending on local culture 
as well. For instance, the U.S. South is famous for its cul-
ture of honor (Nisbett & Cohen, 1996), where reputation 
is important. Cohen  (1998) found that the argument-­
related homicide rate was higher in more residentially 
stable rather than in mobile Southern and Western 
states. By contrast, the argument-­related homicide rate 
tended to be higher in residentially mobile states than in 
stable Northern states. The results from the U.S. South 
seem contradictory to the extant findings on the surface. 
Cohen explains that residential stability means the old 
tradition continues, in the case of the South, the culture 
of honor, increasing the prevalence of the argument-­
related homicide rate. Thus, the role of residential mo-
bility could be moderated by local culture. This needs to 
be further investigated in the future.

community has often statistically controlled for other re-
lated variables such as median income and population

density, other research has not explored the role of resi-
dential mobility distinct from other related variables 
such as multicultural experiences, cosmopolitanism, 
globalization, and social mobility.
There is a large literature on multicultural experiences, 
or the effect of living abroad on various psychological 
phenomena (see Maddux et al., 2021 for a recent review). 
For example, multicultural experiences are shown to 
be associated with creativity (Leung et al., 2008), self-­
concept clarity (Adam et al.,  2018), generalized trust 
(Cao et al.,  2014), and reduced stereotyping (Tadmor 
et al., 2012), but also immoral behavior (Lu et al., 2017). 
These findings are generally consistent with the litera-
ture on residential mobility. Furthermore, they suggest 
that residential mobility might be potentially associated 
with self-­concept clarity and creativity. However, there 
is an important distinction between residential mobility 
in general and multicultural experiences: Multicultural 
experience involves moving to another country, whereas 
residential mobility could be within a limited geograph-
ical and cultural region. As the literature on residential 
mobility matures, it is important to explore the role of 
both geographical and cultural distance in the future.
To the extent that the majority of residential moves 
are related to jobs, and jobs are more abundant in 
urban areas, the majority of residential moves are to-
ward urban areas (Lucas Jr.,  2004). In wealthy coun-
tries at least, urban areas are also more cosmopolitan. 
Recently, psychologists have studied various correlates 
of cosmopolitanism (see Leung et al., 2015). For exam-
ple, cosmopolitanism is associated with the value of 
cultural diversity, cultural openness, and global proso-
ciality. Cosmopolitan values are endorsed more by indi-
viduals high in openness to experience and extraversion, 
the same personality predictors of residential mobility 
(Sevincer et al., 2017).
Similar to cosmopolitanism, globalization also in-
volves individuals moving to a new place, this case a new 
country, and also everyday interactions with foreigners 
and foreign cultures. Globalization is supposed to com-
press the psychological distance between cultures, while 
simultaneously accentuating the differences (Chiu & 
Cheng, 2007). When a foreign culture poses a psycho-
logical threat, people show defensive responses to glo-
balization (Torelli et al., 2011). In that case, residential 
mobility could have assimilating or contrasting effects 
on an individual, depending on how a destination is con-
strued. Like globalization, residential mobility presents 
both opportunities and challenges. When challenges are 
highlighted, mobility evokes conservative reactions such 
as familiarity-­seeking (Oishi, Miao, et al., 2012), whereas 
when opportunities are highlighted, mobility evokes 
exploratory behaviors such as self-­disclosure (Schug 
et al., 2010) and generalized trust (Thomson et al., 2018). 
It is critical in the future to investigate how a psychologi-
cal threat associated with a residential move might serve 
as a moderator of residential mobility effects.
Lastly, it is important to explore how residential mo-
bility interacts with changes in socioeconomic status. 
People often move when they find a better job (upward 
mobility) or when they lose a job (downward mobility). 
While intergenerational upward social mobility, the de-
gree to which one moves up or down the economic ladder 
compared with their childhood socioeconomic status, 
has been intensely investigated (Destin, 2019), more re-
search is needed on how the effects of residential mobil-
ity are nullified or amplified during these changes.
Remaining questions
Much of the current literature has focused on the asso-
ciations of residential mobility at static time points (e.g., 
the amount of residential mobility in the past 5 years), 
yet rates of residential mobility are constantly changing, 
bringing with them a host of psychological consequences. 
For example, the United States' current rate of residen-
tial mobility is half of what it was in the 1970s. This shift 
was accompanied by decreases in individualism, hap-
piness, trust, optimism, and endorsement of the notion 
that hard work leads to success (Buttrick & Oishi, 2021). 
Whereas residential mobility has been decreasing in 
South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the United States 
over the last few decades, mobility in Austria, Hungary, 
and Spain has been recently rising (Alvarez et al., 2021). 
There is still much to learn about how rates of change in 
mobility affect individuals and cultures.
Next, more attention should be paid to the type 
of move, specifically the location from and to which 
one is moving. How the socio-­ecological factors in 
these locations come into play is still understudied. 
For example, one study found that childhood resi-
dential mobility was associated with worse cognitive 
performance and self-­regulation, but this effect was 
moderated by rates of poverty in origin and destina-
tion neighborhoods. Specifically, mobile children who 
moved out of high poverty neighborhoods performed 
better than stable children who remained in high pov-
erty neighborhoods. By contrast, mobile children who 
moved out of low poverty neighborhoods performed 
worse than those who stayed in low poverty neighbor-
hoods. Poverty level at the destination neighborhood 
also mattered: mobile children who moved into low 
poverty neighborhoods performed better than those 
who stayed in low poverty neighborhoods, but mobile 
children who moved into high poverty neighborhoods 
performed worse than stable children in high poverty 
neighborhoods (Roy et al., 2014). If these researchers 
had examined mobility alone and ignored the context 
of the original and new residential areas, these import-
ant distinctions would not have been found.
While the consequences of residential mobility have 
been widely explored, less attention has been paid so far 
to its antecedents. Other disciplines such as economics

RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY
and policy have looked at structural factors (e.g., housing 
supply, access to credit) that impact the ease of residen-
tial mobility. In psychological studies, various personal-
ity traits tend to predict mobility behavior. Additionally, 
expecting versus not expecting a move can have effects 
on actual moving behavior (Kan, 1999). Some moves are 
desired, such as wanting to live in an area with a more 
matching political ideology (Carson & Gimpel,  2019; 
Motyl et al., 2014); other moves are forced, such as los-
ing a job and having to relocate to one elsewhere. Future 
investigation is needed as to how various reasons inter-
play to influence moving behaviors and their associated 
consequences.
In conclusion, psychological research on residential 
mobility over the last two decades has dramatically in-
creased, shedding new light on diverse, central issues 
in psychological science, ranging from self-­concepts, 
identity, and well-­being to friendships and romantic re-
lationships, and from group affiliations and intergroup 
relations to community involvement and cultural differ-
ences. There are, however, numerous issues that remain 
to be resolved. We hope this article will spark new re-
search on the role of residential mobility in various as-
pects of consumer psychology.
