JOIN THE IDEAL
HOME COMMUNITY
My to-do list
for January
The things I‚Äôll be planning, doing 
and shopping for this month
T
his Christmas, I‚Äôll be taking a
less-is-more approach, planning
some perfect downtime and
challenging my family to a board game
fest they‚Äôll never forget.
SLOWING DOWN I‚Äôm pouring my
physical and mental resources into the
run-up, so I can do as little as possible
when the holidays actually arrive. I have
plans for extreme indolence involving 
(in this order): my M&S cashmere
joggers; my parents‚Äô squashiest sofa; a
Miss Marple box set (Joan Hickson, of
course); lots of cheese. Weight Watchers
is on hold until 1 January!
UNPLUGGING Richmond Christmases
do tend to be a bit telly-centric. I don‚Äôt
actually have a problem with that ‚Äì I‚Äôm
emotionally attached to Marple, the littlest
Richmonds have an annual date with
The Muppets Christmas Carol and Ma
Richmond will be borderline cantankerous
if she misses the Strictly Christmas spesh.
But the dining table‚Äôs going to do double
duty this year as a jigsaw and board game
station, so we can actually engage with
each other face to face. I know the kids will
love some sustained time with the biggest
Richmonds, who must seem to be either
always working or glued to their phones.
APPRECIATING THE LITTLE THINGS
I walked into my parents‚Äô living room
recently to Ô¨Ånd my creaky old Pa
kneeling at the foot of a little Richmond,
diligently Ô¨Åling her verruca (apologies if 
you‚Äôre eating). Watching
him peer through his
bifocals at the offending
fungus, I felt a sudden rush
of love for Pa and his quiet 
heroism. The child in
question was absorbed in
Octonauts and therefore
oblivious to the pathos of
the moment, and it struck me
how many small acts of love
by the parents Richmond
my sister and I must have
missed or forgotten over the years.
They‚Äôre not big on displays of affection,
but this Christmas, Ma and Pa will be
experiencing some serious payback.
SCALING BACK Every year I feel a
bit guilty about the excess ‚Äì my over-
shopping for gifts and panic-buying
food nobody will eat. I do it out of fear
of disappointing someone ‚Äì will this
be the year they‚Äôll actually want to eat
the Christmas cake and boxes of dates?
I‚Äôm going to try a quality-not-quantity
approach this year and give the stuff
we don‚Äôt really need to the food bank
‚Äì Ô¨Ånd your nearest at trusselltrust.org.

New Year from the Ideal Home team‚Ä¶

January SHOPPING IDEAS
Antiqued glass
Vintage-style mirrors have gone rough-luxe
THE NEXT BIG THING
THE STORY SO FAR Aged glass may
bring to mind grand old palaces, but the
antiqued-mirror finish is having a modern
makeover. Shaking off its shabby-chic
persona, this mottled effect gives a rough-
luxe look to walls and alcoves, especially
when used with industrial-style furniture.
WHERE WE‚ÄôVE SEEN IT Whether it‚Äôs
used for tiles, panels or wallpaper, this
trend is taking a hold on walls. Evoking
faded grandeur is Cole & Son‚Äôs King‚Äôs
Mirror wallpaper ‚Äì inspired by baroque
quarters of Hampton Court Palace ‚Äì and
Harlequin‚Äôs crackle-effect wallcovering,
Eglomise. Bespoke companies, such as
Rupert Bevan, Rough Old Glass, Cl√©
and Glassology, create varied finishes on
antiqued-glass panels, tiles and kitchen
splashbacks. Andrew Martin combines the
trend with his signature industrial style in
Victor ‚Äì a glass-topped metal coffee table.
LATEST RELEASES Ochre‚Äôs Moon tables
feature hand-tarnished glass tops with
skinny steel frames, and Garth Roberts has
designed a set of storage boxes for The
Conran Shop, in collaboration with Italian
expert Antique Mirror, which uses artisan
techniques to create unusual glass finishes.

raig Roman joined Dobbies
in 2002, and is now the head
of visual merchandising,
with responsibility for
revitalising the Dobbies shopping
displays and presenting its products
in an exciting and approachable way.
‚ÄòGarden retail is an inspiring and
challenging environment that
constantly changes with each
new season,‚Äô explains Craig. ‚ÄòOur
customers love their homes, and
Dobbies‚Äô key focus is to inspire and
share ideas about how to make your
home and garden seasonally relevant.
It‚Äôs a rewarding place to work, as you
are encouraging people to embrace
nature and a greener lifestyle.‚Äô
Christmas is an important time of
year for the stores, with a dedicated
area set aside in each branch that
is transformed into a magical winter
wonderland to showcase the new
range of festive products.
THE MAN BEHIND THE LOOK
Born and brought up in a rural part
of Johannesburg, South Africa, with
his Portuguese mother, Hungarian
father and three elder sisters, Craig‚Äôs
love of gardening and the great
outdoors started at an early age.
‚ÄòWe kept our own ducks, geese and
chickens, and grew all our own
vegetables, including some exotic
ingredients for South Africa, such
as paprika, kohlrabi and aubergines,‚Äô
says Craig. ‚ÄòAs a child, I used to
enjoy gardening with my mum,
and my love of good food stems

Meet the man responsible for turning Dobbies
into an inspiring winter wonderland at Christmas
Craig Roman
from my parents, too. Because of their
backgrounds, I‚Äôd go to school with
unusual ingredients in my lunchbox,
such as rye bread and cured hams. 
We are deÔ¨Ånitely a family of foodies.‚Äô
A childhood interest in art and
dancing led Craig into studying  
Ô¨Åne arts and different forms of  
dance before he started his career in
fashion retail. ‚ÄòI used to work in
Stuttafords department store in South
Africa, which is where I met Liz Muller,
who is now the global creative director
of Starbucks,‚Äô explains Craig. ‚ÄòShe was
my Ô¨Årst visual-merchandising boss

who showed me that anything and
everything is possible with hard
work and conviction.‚Äô 
Craig worked his way up in
retail to become the head of
visual merchandising at Edgars,
South Africa‚Äôs biggest and best
department store. ‚ÄòI‚Äôd reached the
top of my game in South Africa,
so I decided to come to England
to work and started all over again
from grass-roots level on the shop
floor as a visual merchandiser,‚Äô
he says. ‚ÄòAfter an initial stint at
Dobbies, I then spent 
five years at Wyevale 
Garden Centres, but 
came back to Dobbies
in 2012. The highlight
of my career to date  
is heading up visual
merchandising for  
the best garden and 
home centres in the 
UK. I‚Äôm very proud  
to work here.‚Äô
HOME FOR CHRISTMAS
Craig now lives in a little village in
Fife with his partner Adam, who works
in the restaurant industry. ‚ÄòOur house
is an eclectic mix of old and new, with
a good twist of African antiquity and
injections of gardenalia ‚Äì I have
at least 30 treasured house plants,
and my garden changes seasonally
with my moods,‚Äô he says. It is where
the couple will be spending Christmas
this year with friends and family from
both London and South Africa. ‚ÄòI love
Christmas,‚Äô says Craig. ‚ÄòWe always
have a real tree in the house and
hang up stockings on Christmas Eve.
I make our stockings from scratch
each year and Ô¨Åll them with
personalised surprises. Being a foodie,
I can‚Äôt resist reinventing the traditional
Christmas meal. Last year, I did three
ravioli baubles ‚Äì one golden orb
stuffed with tender
turkey smothered
with a bread and butter
sauce, a red one stuffed
with cranberries, red
onion and parsnips,
and a green one for
a starter that was
filled with Brussels
sprouts, parmesan
and smoked bacon.‚Äô
THE CRAIG ROMAN PHILOSOPHY
‚ÄòI believe you should let desired
objects live in the right space, so they
bring beauty to your life. I also love
the Chinese proverb, ‚ÄúIf you want to
be happy for a short time, get drunk;
if you want to be happy for a long
time, fall in love; if you want to be
happy forever, take up gardening‚Äù.‚Äô

THE PROPERTY
A traditional Dutch ‚Äòdike‚Äô house
built in 1890 in Abcoude, near
Amsterdam, Holland. The owners
bought it in April 2013.
WHO LIVES HERE
Jeltje and Erik Smit, with
their baby daughter, Steffi.
Jeltje is a photographer
and Erik is an estate agent.
THE LOOK
Clean lines and minimal
details make a sleek background
for soft, warm textures and
a palette of white and cream.
LESSONS LEARNED
Bedrooms don‚Äôt have to
be on the first floor. By creating
space for our bedroom
downstairs, we‚Äôve left plenty
of space in the loft room for
a nursery and office.
4 Living room
‚ÄòErik wanted a flat-screen
TV but I didn‚Äôt like the
idea of a black screen in
the room, so I designed
a birch ply cupboard to
hide it in,‚Äô says Jeltje
For a similar star, try
the small distressed
white wash star wood
ornament, ¬£6, B&Q
3 Open-plan living
room/kitchen
By knocking through the
walls on the ground floor,
the Smits have created a
single open-plan space
large enough for a living
area and kitchen

wedding blanket, ¬£284,

‚ÄòCreating an open-plan kitchen,
dining and living area seemed the
best way to achieve a sense  
of light and space‚Äô
Y
ou need to be quick to find a
great property, but Jeltje Smit
literally ran to find her perfect
family home in Abcoude in
Holland. ‚ÄòIt was Christmas
2012 and I was jogging by the
dike when I saw this house for sale,‚Äô she says.
‚ÄòAt the time, my husband Erik and I were living
in a converted windmill on the other side of
the village. It had been in our family for 45
years ‚Äì my parents lived there, then my brother,
and Erik and I had been there for five years.
‚ÄòThe windmill was lovely, but it was small
and impractical, with crooked walls and narrow
stairs. We wanted to start a family, so needed
something larger ‚Äì and that‚Äôs when I saw this
place. We weren‚Äôt the only ones keen to buy
‚û∫
5 Kitchen
‚ÄòOur builder made the
units out of birch ply,‚Äô says
Jeltje. ‚ÄòI had to whitewash
them five times to get
the result I wanted‚Äô
For similar cabinets, try
the Innova Luca matt white,
from ¬£38.66 for a base
unit, DIY Kitchens

the house. It had just gone on the market and
had been viewed 20 times, so we put our name
on the list. Gradually, the other bidders dropped
out as they realised it was in poor condition.
Finally, in April 2013, the property was ours.‚Äô
The previous owner was an elderly lady. ‚ÄòShe
was remarkable ‚Äì she was 104 and still climbed
the stairs to her bedroom every night,‚Äô says
Jeltje. ‚ÄòBut the 19th-century property wasn‚Äôt
insulated and its roof beams and floorboards
were rotten and needed to be replaced, as did
the windows and wiring. There was an old
fireplace and three layers of dirty carpet.‚Äô 
The couple had big plans for the house. ‚ÄòTo
make the most of the building‚Äôs footprint, we
decided to extend into the adjoining garage
and turn it into a downstairs bedroom for

us,‚Äô says Jeltje. ‚ÄòWe also wanted to knock out
all the internal walls to create an open-plan
kitchen, dining and living area. It seemed the
best way to achieve a sense of light and space.‚Äô
It was eight months before they were granted
planning permission and could put their ideas
into practice. The couple stayed in the windmill
while the six-month transformation took place.
‚ÄòWe took down the walls and ceiling and tore
up the floorboards, so that only the exterior
walls and roof were left,‚Äô says Jeltje. ‚ÄòIt gave the
builder an empty shell to work with. Luckily, we
had a good contractor and everything went
smoothly. He made the building structurally
sound, installed insulation and underfloor
heating, and even built the kitchen, bathroom
and storage. He made all our ideas come to life.‚Äô
It can be hard to make a small space look
uncluttered, or an all-white room feel warm
and cosy, but the Smits have achieved both.
Creating a clean, spare background was key.
The flooring is poured concrete with an
anhydride layer, giving a smooth base that looks
like resin but is cheaper. The couple chose
handleless kitchen units for a fuss-free effect and
sleek and contemporary bathroom fittings. The
d√©cor throughout is a minimal palette of white,
cream and wood. ‚ÄòThe walls in our old house
were white because it made the rooms seem
more spacious,‚Äô says Jeltje. ‚ÄòEven though ‚û∫

wool and wood, has added a warm, rustic look.‚Äô
The ground floor now has an apartment
feel. ‚ÄòHaving the sleeping, living, cooking and
dining areas all on one floor is very practical,‚Äô
says Jeltje. Upstairs, in the revamped roof
space, the former bedroom has been divided
into a study and a nursery. ‚ÄòDuring the move,
I found out I was pregnant,‚Äô says Jeltje, who
has since given birth to a daughter, Steffi. ‚ÄòThis
house makes a wonderful family home and
we feel part of a community. Our last place was
in a more remote spot. Here, we are still in the
countryside but we have lots of neighbours.‚Äô
For the festive season, Jeltje has filled the
rooms with decorations, many of which are
home-made. And of course, in this house, it‚Äôs
guaranteed to be a white Christmas. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre
looking forward to spending time at home as
a family,‚Äô says Jeltje. ‚ÄòMy parents, grandmother
and our siblings will all be coming over.‚Äô IH

W
hen Rachel Holland
and Ruben Stephenson
bought their first home
together, they had
no idea that the once
dilapidated Georgian
town house would become such a sociable hub,
especially during the festive season. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve got
such lovely neighbours,‚Äô says Rachel. ‚ÄòOne year,
a Christmas party turned into an open house ‚Äì
80 revellers squeezed in for a fun evening.‚Äô
The couple chose to buy a house in the
Portsmouth Harbour area, close to where their
commercial-diving business is based, and when
they discovered this period property, they knew
‚û∫
it was the one for them. ‚ÄòI‚Äôve always wanted to
live in a character home and I was blown away
by the place,‚Äô says Ruben. ‚ÄòThe sea views are
amazing and I decided that no matter what
condition it was in, we‚Äôd have to buy it.‚Äô
However, the couple had a reality check
when they were confronted with the property‚Äôs
tired interior. ‚ÄòIt had been a rental property for
years and was bland and soulless,‚Äô says Rachel.
‚ÄòAll the character had been ripped out or
covered up, and it still had an outside loo.‚Äô
While others may have dismissed the work
on the property as a step too far, optimistic
Ruben and Rachel relished the opportunity
to breathe new life into it. Once the house

was theirs, they set to work and began stripping
the property back to its bare bones.
‚ÄòIt was cathartic to get rid of the smelly
old carpets and removing the wallpaper was
intriguing as, layer by layer, the house‚Äôs past
was revealed,‚Äô says Rachel. ‚ÄòWe couldn‚Äôt believe
it when we were handed some handwritten
deeds that dated back to 1745.‚Äô
The couple lived in the house for a year as
they worked out how to remodel the higgledy-
piggledy layout and began to decide on the
look they wanted. Aiming to preserve the
property‚Äôs character, they opted for a traditional
feel but with contemporary elements mixed in
for a fresh, eclectic look. ‚ÄòWe were also keen to
have children and wanted to make the house
family friendly,‚Äô says Rachel.
In 2008, the work began. An open-plan
kitchen-diner was created downstairs, while on
the first floor, walls were repositioned and a
bathroom removed to create a larger bedroom
and shower room. To make space for a family
bathroom on the third floor, walls in the two
bedrooms were repositioned. Rotting windows
were replaced, brickwork exposed and floors
either relaid or carpeted.
After their children, Millie and Zeb, were
born, the couple needed more space. They
decided to convert the loft into a main ‚û∫

bedroom and shower room, which would free
up a bedroom for guests and create a top-floor
suite that would take advantage of the sea view.
After contacting architect Carl Leroy-Smith,
plans were drawn up. ‚ÄòWe realised that since
the joists would have to be removed, this was
a great chance to gain extra head height in the
children‚Äôs bedrooms,‚Äô says Rachel.
Once planning permission was gained, work
on the next phase of the transformation began
in 2014. The couple hired builder Jeremy
Westcott of Westcott Construction. ‚ÄòJeremy
and his team were fantastic,‚Äô says Rachel.
‚ÄòHe knew just what we were after. In addition
to tackling the loft and improving the family
bathroom, he replaced the front door and some
windows, and redecorated the entire house.‚Äô
Rachel and Ruben are delighted with their
home. They‚Äôve created a unique look that
stays true to the property‚Äôs period character,
combining exposed brickwork and traditional
styling with touches of contemporary colour
and detail. This elegant property has become
a home the whole family can enjoy, both at
Christmas time and throughout the year.

C
hristmas is all about celebrating
with friends and family,  
but when the festive season
coincides with your wedding
anniversary, there‚Äôs even more
cause to string up the fairy 
lights and make a toast with a glass of
Champagne. Miranda Huijs and Machiel van
der Plas got married at Christmas three years
ago. ‚ÄòWe have a bauble from our honeymoon
hotel that comes out every year as a memento,‚Äô
says Miranda. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs a special time of year for us,
as not only does it mark our commitment to
each other, it‚Äôs also when our children came
together as one big, blended family. We invite
lots of relatives to share the celebrations with us.‚Äô
There couldn‚Äôt be a better place for a family
party. This detached villa in the pretty Dutch
town of Velp was originally a grocer‚Äôs shop.
When Miranda and Machiel Ô¨Årst saw it in June
2008, the large front room still had its original
store Ô¨Åttings, including honey-coloured
wooden shelves they were determined to keep.
Unfortunately, the rest of the listed building
was in poor repair. 
The roof leaked, the ground Ô¨Çoor was divided
into a series of small, impractical spaces, the
Ô¨Çoors and window frames were rotten, and
there was damp throughout. But there were  
a few magical remnants that hinted at the
property‚Äôs potential ‚Äì enamelled tiles around
the entrance, oak beams, glass-panelled doors
and high, decorative ceilings. ‚ÄòWe didn‚Äôt

hesitate to put in an offer,‚Äô says Miranda. ‚ÄòJust
Ô¨Åve months later, the house was ours.‚Äô
Machiel is an expert in period renovations
‚Äì he founded his company, Hermon Erfgoed,
which specialises in the restoration of religious
and historic monuments, in 2012. Miranda,  
a former youth worker, is now a project
manager for the business. But, back in 2008,
their focus was on creating a home for their
children from their previous relationships.
‚ÄòMachiel and I both wanted a fresh start and we
needed a place that was big enough for our two
families,‚Äô Miranda explains. ‚ÄòWe started from
scratch, taking nothing from our former homes,
and we‚Äôve Ô¨Ålled this house with things we both
like. Luckily, our tastes are very similar.‚Äô
The family lived in the house for a year
while Miranda and Machiel plotted out the
restoration project and obtained planning
permission for the various structural changes
they wanted. They then moved into rented
accommodation nearby for the next year, hiring
a local contractor to carry out the work. As
well as the necessary repairs to the roof, Ô¨Çoors
and windows, the major change was the
reconÔ¨Åguration of walls to create larger rooms
and improve the Ô¨Çow of the space.
‚ÄòOur goal was to pare back the rooms, so the
period features wouldn‚Äôt Ô¨Åght with the rest of
the d√©cor,‚Äô says Miranda. ‚ÄòApart from Eva and
Isa‚Äôs bedroom and the bathroom, the house
has white walls and waxed wood Ô¨Çoors. I look
on it as a serene blank canvas. I choose my ‚û∫

pieces carefully and they come into their own
when there are no distractions.‚Äô
The former shop room is a showcase for
Miranda‚Äôs decorating style. The original
Ô¨Çoor-to-ceiling cabinets have been left in
situ and are now Ô¨Ålled with everything from
dinnerware to scarves ‚Äì the trappings of family
life with Ô¨Åve children. For most of the year,
this room is used as an ofÔ¨Åce, but at Christmas
the desks are replaced with a dining table and 
it becomes the setting for feasts with the
extended family. Glass-panelled doors give a
glimpse into the living room beyond, where  
a wood burner sits in front of the original
fireplace. A scattering of cushions and rugs
link the ChesterÔ¨Åeld sofa and leather armchair.
Across the central hall, the couple removed
the ceiling-height cupboard that divided the 
kitchen and dining area. ‚ÄòIt made the room
more spacious,‚Äô Miranda explains.
Upstairs was a similar story, as they knocked
through two small rooms to create Eva and Isa‚Äôs
bedroom. A further two rooms at the back of
the house were combined to create a luxurious
bathroom with an oval bath as its centrepiece.
‚ÄòI saw a photo of this bath in a magazine and
I had to have it,‚Äô says Miranda, who admits her
biggest indulgence is sinking into the bubbles
and gazing at the sky through the Velux window.
‚ÄòWhen we‚Äôre restoring properties, Machiel
and I work hard to Ô¨Ånd the heart of the house,‚Äô
says Miranda. ‚ÄòI‚Äôm really proud we‚Äôve achieved
that in our home, too. The fact that our family
looks forward to gathering here to celebrate
Christmas ‚Äì and our anniversary ‚Äì is a tribute
to its warm and welcoming atmosphere.‚Äô

‚ÄòOur goal was to pare back
the rooms, so the period
features wouldn‚Äôt fight with
the rest of the d√©cor‚Äô

W
hen Christine Hayes
told friends that  
she and her husband 
Gary had bought  
an empty shell of a
property, she wasn‚Äôt 
exaggerating. Although the newly built house
had a basic kitchen and bathroom, there were
no Ô¨Åreplaces, no Ô¨Çooring and no other Ô¨Åttings.
But that was perfect for Christine. ‚ÄòI wanted  
to create a home just for us, so the fact that
we didn‚Äôt inherit someone else‚Äôs ideas was a
bonus,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòWe were moving from a small,
two-bedroom, semi-detached house into a place
with lots of light and space, and plenty of scope
for ideas, so I couldn‚Äôt wait to get started.‚Äô
Christine and Gary wanted to introduce
a modern, classic style that would stand the test
of time. ‚ÄòI love to use a grey-and-white palette
for its overall feeling of sophistication, but
I can‚Äôt live without the odd pop of colour, too,‚Äô
says Christine. ‚ÄòI also wanted to bring in lots
‚û∫
of different textural layers with wool, linen 
and velvet, to create a sense of luxury.‚Äô
As the couple began to shape their new 
look, Christine realised that there was a
fundamental Ô¨Çaw in the layout of the house 
that was going to be a hindrance to how they
liked to live. ‚ÄòI always felt that the upstairs
space was disproportionate to the downstairs,‚Äô
she says. ‚ÄòThe kitchen was quite small and we
had a double garage that we didn‚Äôt really need.‚Äô
The solution was to build a single-storey
extension across the back of the house,
removing a utility room in the process, to
double the size of the kitchen. ‚ÄòThe kitchen was
virtually a no-go area while the work was being
done, so we set up a makeshift kitchen in the
living room and managed like that until the
new Ô¨Åttings were installed,‚Äô says Christine.
Next, they turned one of the garages into
a dining room and used part of the remaining
garage to create a new utility space. Roof lights
were installed in the extension to let more
3 Kitchen
Building an extension
doubled the size of 
the kitchen. Grey-
painted units and an
engineered-oak floor
create a modern-
country scheme

Patterned wall tiles 
make an interesting

used the grey of the 
units as a starting point
for the colour scheme  
in the snug to ensure 
the rooms blend together

‚ÄòI love shopping and can happily spend all day browsing the
shops for beautiful objects. I love the way fabric, accessories

light into the cooking area, and double doors
now lead out to the walled garden at the back of
the house. ‚ÄòThe extension and conversions have
almost doubled the size of the downstairs living
space and made the house more balanced,‚Äô says
Christine. ‚ÄòA lot of people these days like to
have an open-plan dining room and kitchen,
but we were keen to have a formal dining room,
so we had somewhere really comfortable and
cosy to sit when we are entertaining friends
and family, away from the cooking smells and
paraphernalia of the kitchen.‚Äô
Christine‚Äôs great talent is in creating a
cohesive look throughout her entire home.
The colour scheme of sophisticated, soothing
neutrals looks all the more luxurious with
her choice of rich but subtle accent shades,
including deep burgundy, pink and green,
enhancing each room.
In the living room, plenty of cushions, bold
fabric designs and layers of textiles create
an intimate space that comes into its own
‚û∫
on cold winter nights. Christine felt a focal 
point here was essential. ‚ÄòIf there is no central
feature in a room, it can be very difÔ¨Åcult to
arrange the furniture,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI think living
rooms are much cosier with a proper Ô¨Åreplace
and we didn‚Äôt skimp on ours as we wanted it 
to be a key piece.‚Äô They chose an Elgin & Hall
design for its warm tones and simplicity.  
‚ÄòWe took those simplistic elements through 
the whole house so that the rooms would 
flow seamlessly, even though they all have
different identities,‚Äô says Christine.
The couple gradually replaced all the
furniture that they had brought from their
previous house, with sofas, beds, lamps
and tables more suited to the size of their
new home. ‚ÄòWe bought things as and when
we could afford them, until we had Ô¨Ånally
upgraded everything,‚Äô says Christine.
The d√©cor is an ongoing process and
Christine loves to introduce fresh trends from
time to time. ‚ÄòRight now, I have my eye on
6 Main bedroom
‚ÄòI like layers of neutral
tones because they are  
a timeless backdrop,‚Äô 
says Christine. She  
used the same lilac  
plaid on the headboard 
and the curtains for  
a co-ordinated finish

a couple of new designer wallpapers that might
Ô¨Ånd their way in soon,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI absolutely
love shopping and would happily spend all
day, every day, browsing the shops for beautiful
objects. I love the way fabric, accessories or
a splash of colour can completely change the
look and feel of a whole room.‚Äô
This interest in evolving style is probably
why Christine loves Christmas so much. She
buys new baubles and decorations for the tree
each year, and stocks up on scented candles
and diffusers to make each room smell inviting.
‚ÄòIt‚Äôs all about the attention to detail,‚Äô she says.
‚ÄòLast year, I bought some wonderful dragonÔ¨Çy
napkin rings for the dining table and everyone
commented on them. When you live in a house
and use it every day, I think it‚Äôs important that
you surround yourself with things that reÔ¨Çect
who you are. There‚Äôs no better feeling than
coming home at the end of the day.‚Äô IH

1
Choose your base colour Whether
it‚Äôs Ô¨Çooring or a wall, the base colour
will be the largest area of colour in your
room, so place a generous sample of it
onto your board. Including carpet samples
will help you think about texture, too.
2
Add an accent tone A dramatic
contrast or an accent just a few tones
away from your base colour? Use your
moodboard to play with options and
layer it with swatches of fabric, scraps
of wallpaper and paint colour charts.
3
Find the right accessories
These will really set the tone in your
room ‚Äì go for ones that share an accent
colour and stick to a single theme. Don‚Äôt
mix styles, or your Ô¨Ånished scheme will
look messy rather than effortlessly eclectic.

1
THE 70-20-10 RULE For a
balanced scheme, keep 70% of
the elements (say, walls and Ô¨Çoors)
as one colour, then add 20% in
a second colour (fabrics) and
10% in an accent (accessories).
2
THE PATTERN RULE When
mixing patterns, use large with 
medium or medium with small,
never large with small. Pick prints
that share a colour in common.
3
THE PAINTED BOX RULE
The look of paint changes
according to the time of day and
the light in a room. Paint the inside
of a large box with a tester to
create a miniature ‚Äòroom‚Äô and see
how the colour changes during
the day within a 3D space.
AND FINALLY‚Ä¶ Always add
a surprise. A focal point ‚Äì whether
it‚Äôs a feature wall or a piece of art
‚Äì is the short cut to a ‚Äòwow‚Äô room.
Decorating?
FOLLOW THE 3
GOLDEN RULES

WHY WE LOVE THEM If
you‚Äôre after the look and feel  
of naturally textured finishes,
such as marble, plaster, brick or
cement, but can‚Äôt work with the
real thing, then faux Ô¨Ånishes in
wallpapers and fabrics are for
you. Thanks to the latest 3D
effects and high-definition
digital printing techniques, 
you can achieve the illusion  
of stone or brick instantly.
WHERE TO USE THEM In  
a living room or dining room, 
concrete-, plaster- or brick-
effect wallpaper and modern
streamlined furniture will give
an urban, industrial vibe. The
unfinished appearance also
works well in a kitchen, creating
a rustic look when teamed with 
wooden units. In the bedroom,
bold-coloured marble patterns
can add an opulent feel.
HOW TO USE THEM
Highlight a feature wall with
brick-effect wallpaper  
on a chimney breast or use
authentic-looking replicas for
marble tiles in a bathroom.
Cushions and bed linen in
marble-effect fabric are a subtle
way to embrace the trend.
HOW TO ACCESSORISE
THEM Add warmth with rich
colours and decorative items in
organic shapes. Light fittings 
in gold and copper, textured
fabrics including velvet, and
natural materials, such as
stripped wood, will soften any
hardness associated with stone.

THE COMPANY New British textile
company Olivia Bard produces diverse,
beautifully crafted fabrics and
decorative window dressings, inspired
by designer Olivia‚Äôs travels and love
of the English countryside. Artisan
hand-crafted details, such as hand-
block printing and cut embroidery,
as well as digital prints, are all part  
of the brand‚Äôs signature look.
THE NEW COLLECTION Taking
inspiration from the natural world,
Tamed Spirit captures the beauty of
organic forms in soft watercolour
prints, intricate woven textures and 
vibrant Ô¨Çoral motifs. With a palette
reÔ¨Çecting the colours found in nature,
the collection pairs rich, earthy tones
with accents of chartreuse, coral and
powder blue for a modern take on
botanical patterns and themes.
WHY WE LOVE IT Each fabric is
created using techniques such as
digital printing, herringbone weaves
and hand-drawn designs, and is woven
in a choice of yarns, including richly
textured cotton and linen blends. These
elegant fabrics can be used on a variety
of soft furnishings, allowing you to bring
gorgeous winter Ô¨Çorals into your home.

LOCATION Situated just behind
Buckingham Palace in the heart
of Belgravia, this English institution
is the only Ô¨Åve-star London hotel
that‚Äôs still owned by the family that
built it in 1910. It is now run by Jeremy
Goring, who is the fourth generation
to take the helm.
ROOMS The hotel‚Äôs 69 rooms are
all sumptuously decorated and have
names such as Delightful and
Splendid. The hotel has Ô¨Åve suites
and each one is serviced by its own
footman, who is at the guests‚Äô beck
and call. The Royal suite (right),
which interior designer Russell Sage
created out of Ô¨Åve bedrooms, has
two bedrooms, two reception rooms
and a balcony that runs the length
of the top Ô¨Çoor, with stunning views
of the city. Feeling more like a luxury
apartment than a hotel suite, it has
a traditional yet glamorous feel and
features rewoven, historic silks by
the renowned Gainsborough Silk
Company, as well as a unique
collection of British antiques.
FAMOUS FOR Its high level of luxury.
Recognised as one of the world‚Äôs
Ô¨Ånest hotels, The Goring was named
Hotel of the Year in 2010 and also
won the World‚Äôs Best Service category.
It also serves up beautifully cooked
British food in The Dining Room ‚Äì
its Michelin-starred restaurant.
CELEBRITY GUESTS The Goring
is too polite to mention any famous
visitors it might have, but the Queen
is said to use the lounge area each
year for her staff‚Äôs Christmas lunch.

showers
The hectic pace of modern life
means that we shower far more
than we soak, with the average
Briton taking 227 showers each
year, according to LateRooms.
But old habits die hard, and most
homeowners are reluctant to
ditch their bathtub permanently.
So, to help us squeeze both into
smaller bathrooms or en suites,
shower specialist Roman has created
a collection of new shower enclosures
with doors that swing partially
inwards. This handily keeps intrusion
into bathroom space to a minimum,
as well as adding a modern look.
The Lumin8 Inswing shower
enclosure comes in four sizes, with
a choice of widths from 76cm to
120cm. What‚Äôs more, the wide
frameless doorway means you can
get in and out comfortably in even
the smallest bathroom, no matter 
how speedy you need to be.

W
hen Joan and Richard
Short purchased their
current home in 1992,
they knew they were
taking on a project but
had no idea of exactly
what was in store. ‚ÄòUp until then we‚Äôd lived
in a succession of modern family homes in
Letchworth Garden City, but when our two
boys became teenagers, we thought it was time
to find somewhere to settle,‚Äô explains Joan.
Location was their key consideration, and
the Hertfordshire house they chose stands in a
quiet, tree-lined road of individually designed
detached properties built in the Sixties and
Seventies. ‚ÄòIt had been rented out for a while,
the internal d√©cor was tired and the garden was
overgrown, which made the price competitive,‚Äô
says Joan. ‚ÄòWe could see it had potential, and
we had the time and energy to take it on.‚Äô
The couple added two straightforward
extensions: a single-storey, full-width rear one,
A barrel-vaulted roof above
a large arched window looks
smart and contemporary
to inviting modern home
We love‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶‚Äòthe greater
levels of light
and the
overall sense
of space that
now runs
throughout
the house‚Äô 
which enlarged the living room and created  
a breakfast room and games room, and an
extension above the garage to create a fifth
bedroom. Then, about five years ago, the Shorts
began considering whether they should move
house again. They felt the downstairs of the
property had too many rooms and doors, and
not enough useable space, while the hallway
and rear ground-floor extensions felt dark.
‚ÄòIn the end, we decided we were settled here,
and instead we‚Äôd invest in giving our house 
the wow factor,‚Äô says Richard. ‚ÄòIt was definitely
dated and low on kerb appeal, with poorly
constructed dormer windows. These reduced
the size of the two front bedrooms, which were
very hot in summer and cold in winter.‚Äô
TIME FOR A CHANGE After considering a
number of local architects, Joan and Richard
chose Pentangle Design Group in nearby
Hitchin (01462 431133; pentangledesign.co.uk),
as they felt that partner Robert Downing was in
tune with their aims for the house. Together

they devised a plan to remodel the front of the
property in a way that would be acceptable to
both the planners and the Letchworth Garden
City Heritage Foundation. 
‚ÄòWithin five minutes of Robert‚Äôs follow-up
visit, we knew his proposal would achieve all 
of our objectives,‚Äô says Joan. ‚ÄòFrom a budgeting
perspective, we decided to complete the work
in phases ‚Äì tackling the front of the house in
2012 and the rear in 2013. We also allocated  
a budget of ¬£250,000 for the entire project.‚Äô
GETTING STARTED Once planning
permission had been granted for all the
alterations, the Shorts tendered the project  
to a number of builders, and selected a  
long-established contractor, DB Sharp & Sons 
(01462 672359; dbsharpandsons.co.uk),  
who they knew would complete the work  
to a high standard. The builder assigned  
a project manager to ensure that everything
was completed on schedule, with phases one 
and two each taking six months. 
‚ÄòWe carried on living in the house throughout
this time, and because all the external work 
was tackled during the winter months, it  
was always cold inside,‚Äô says Joan. ‚ÄòWe had
corrugated sheeting rattling and plastic
flapping throughout the night, with dust
everywhere, and we had to use a camping
kitchen to cook for three months.‚Äô
Working within the current footprint, the
internal layout has been reorganised to create
more useable living space, incorporating highly 
‚ÄòWe‚Äôve received so many positive comments from
friends and family. It has become the house of our
dreams and there‚Äôs nothing we would change‚Äô
efficient heating and ventilation systems.  
A modern, redesigned kitchen with the latest
appliances and gadgets replaced the little-used
games room overlooking the rear garden, and
high levels of natural light are now delivered 
to all parts of the house through expansive
windows, glass doors and roof lights.
ADDING KERB APPEAL The property‚Äôs
protruding front walls were extended upwards
to replace the existing inset dormer windows
and enlarge the bedrooms on the first floor.
Externally, the brick house has been clad in 
hand-made clay tiles and oak weatherboarding
for a smarter appearance. ‚ÄòThe oak-clad section
was built in blockwork, and the main bedroom 
is timber framed, with structural steelwork to
support the upper level,‚Äô says Richard.
The existing windows were replaced with
energy-efficient, aluminium-framed ones,
which are powder coated in dark grey. A new
barrel-vaulted zinc roof creates a dynamic
vaulted first-floor landing/seating area at the
top of the stairs, where a bespoke arched oak
window looks out over the front garden.
Despite some late deliveries of materials, 
the builder worked rigidly to the deadline, 
and when the front elevation of the house 
was unveiled for the first time, the Shorts 
were stunned by the transformation. ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve
received so many positive comments from our
friends and family,‚Äô says Joan. ‚ÄòIt has become
the house of our dreams and there‚Äôs absolutely
nothing we would change.‚Äô
A bank of roof 
lights and floor-to-
ceiling windows let in

RENOVATION
KNOW-HOW
Joan and Richard fitted smart new
windows, including a bespoke
arched one made by a local joiner, 
to transform the look of their home.
‚ñ† The right window can dramatically
improve a property‚Äôs appearance, 
its energy efficiency and security.  
A simple alteration to size or shape
can also let much more light flood in.
‚ñ† Purpose-made windows will take
longer and be more costly to fit than
off-the-shelf versions, but one or two
bespoke feature windows can add
personality to a house ‚Äì from corner
glazing to arched or round designs. 
IN DETAIL FEATURE WINDOWS
Use windows to add character, like the Shorts did
‚ñ† Planning permission is not normally
needed for repairing, fitting or
replacing existing windows, and
double glazing can be installed under
permitted development as long as 
the building isn‚Äôt listed or located  
in a conservation area. Building
regulations will apply to thermal
performance and to other elements,
such as safety and ventilation.
‚ñ† Energy-efficient windows come 
in a variety of frames and styles, 
and the BFRC Scheme (bfrc.org) is
the UK‚Äôs national system for rating 
the energy efficiency of windows.

window is a

oubling the floor area of their
detached Thirties north London
home has given Helen and Sean
Ledder and their four children all
the living space they need. Previously, the
Muswell Hill property had felt cramped, but by
building side and rear extensions, converting
the loft and incorporating lots of feature glazing,
they now have a brighter, more practical home.
Chris Jones of Jones Associates Architects
(020 7281 3634; jones-associates.co.uk)
oversaw the project and was recommended by
friends. ‚ÄòWe wanted a modern design that

a key consideration, as the existing wooden
ones were single glazed with leaded lights,

ADDING ROOM Chris drew up plans to
increase the property‚Äôs living space from 
182sq m to 281sq m and in the process create
two extra bedrooms and a bathroom, making
six bedrooms and three bathrooms in total. 
The roof extension and alterations were done
under permitted development rights, but the
ground floor side and rear extensions required
planning permission, which was granted.

LETTING IN LIGHT Rendered blockwork walls
were erected for the single-storey rear and side
extensions, with 5m-long sliding glass doors
installed in the dining area. The small paned
windows were replaced with casement ones,
and new dormers were built upstairs, with 
zinc-clad projecting bay windows constructed
downstairs. These are aluminium framed and
were powder coated grey to match the zinc
cladding on the dormers and parts of the roof. 
Bringing light into the house was key, and
now the property sports a striking triangular
window in one of the bedrooms at the back

WHAT THEY DID
The couple knocked down an old

the house. The ceiling was taken
up to the rafters to create an open,
spacious feel, and two roof lights and
a full-length roof lantern were added.

to create an informal
dining space. The
bench-style seats also
contain hidden storage,
which is handy for son
Oliver‚Äôs toys, while the

K
aren and Dave Smith‚Äôs new
house was so perfect, they
knew they were going to buy
it the minute they saw it. ‚ÄòThe
only downside was that the
kitchen was small and dark,
despite having a lean-to extension along one
side,‚Äô says Karen. ‚ÄòRather than being a useful
extra space, the lean-to ended up as an overÔ¨Çow 
for storage and, with gaps in the kitchen
Ô¨Çoorboards, we even had an invasion of slugs!‚Äô
After living with the cramped layout for four
years, the couple asked an architect to draw up
plans for a single-storey extension across the
width of the house to create a bright, open-plan
family kitchen. ‚ÄòThe room had a low ceiling
below a high sloping roof, so we had that raised
to create a more spacious feel,‚Äô says Karen.
As for the units, she found the Shaker-style
ones she wanted at a local bespoke kitchen
company. ‚ÄòThe designer there instantly knew
the look I was going for,‚Äô says Karen.
The new layout and muted palette make the
room feel relaxing, and the family now enjoy
spending time here. ‚ÄòI have a garden room for
when I work from home,‚Äô says Karen. ‚ÄòBut I prefer
to plug in my laptop here ‚Äì I love it so much.‚Äô

A
fter buying a three-bedroom,
semi-detached house in 
north London four years ago,
Natasha and Jonny Stoller
put renovating its kitchen at
the top of their to-do list. ‚ÄòThe 
room was really dark and narrow,‚Äô says Natasha.
‚ÄòThe cupboards were green and some of the
ceiling was clad in oak, making it feel smaller.‚Äô
The couple originally considered building  
a small extension to add more space to the
kitchen, but they soon realised a few simple
structural changes would be more cost
effective. When they discovered that the
kitchen ceiling had previously been lowered 
to house pipework for the bathroom above it,
Natasha and Jonny decided to raise it. ‚ÄòAdding
more height and knocking down the wall
between the kitchen and family room created
so much extra space and light that we didn‚Äôt
need to add an extension,‚Äô says Natasha.
Jonny had lots of ideas for the best way  
to maximise space in the new layout. ‚ÄòWhen 
our kitchen designer came up with a similar
design, we felt very comfortable,‚Äô says Natasha.
‚ÄòWe couldn‚Äôt be happier with the result.‚Äô

lex and Shaun Knight weren‚Äôt
looking for a renovation
project when they bought
their house in Middlesex
in 2005. ‚ÄòHowever, this
property did offer us the
potential to build out at a later date and we
needed that Ô¨Çexibility, as we were expecting
our second child at the time,‚Äô says Alex.
Some years later, Alex longed for a kitchen
that the whole family could enjoy. ‚ÄòThe original
layout was galley style,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòIt was
completely outdated, with an exposed boiler,
and there wasn‚Äôt even space for a family sized
fridge, so we kept ours in the dining room.
Fortunately, Shaun‚Äôs an architect, so he
designed our open-plan rear extension.‚Äô
Alex‚Äôs dream kitchen was a practical space
for baking, with plenty of storage and room for
the whole family to sit and talk. When it came
to choosing a design, she wanted traditional
Shaker-style units and heritage paint colours,
with modern touches, such as dark laminate
Ô¨Çooring and spotlights. ‚ÄòI went for a timeless
look,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòNow, I‚Äôm totally head-over-heels
in love with the room we‚Äôve created.‚Äô

THE PROPERTY
A four-bedroom, Victorian, terraced
house in Balham, southwest London.
WHO LIVES HERE
Libby and Adam Lygoe, with their
children, Lucas, 15, and Holly, 10.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple lowered the ceiling on
the first floor by 22cm to create more
headroom in the loft area, then they
boxed out and squared off the loft space
to form straight walls. They also
installed a skylight and had
the en-suite bathroom tanked.
THE LOOK
Contemporary classic, with clean
lines and a neutral colour scheme.
LESSONS LEARNED
A loft conversion requires
expertise, so hire professionals
to ensure you achieve the best
layout and a quality finish.
THE LAYOUT On the left of the door are
vanity units with twin basins and mirrored
cabinets above. The bath sits under the
skylight, with a loo to the right. A wall
separates the loo from the shower, which
is to the right of the door
‚ÄòA smart layout
was our goal‚Äô
Take a tip from the Lygoes
and maximise your space

FORWHERETOBUYITEMSSHOWN,TURNTHEPAGE
T
ired of years of renting, Libby
and Adam Lygoe decided to buy
a Victorian house that needed
refurbishing. ‚ÄòAs we‚Äôd never
renovated before, we didn‚Äôt get
a total wreck,‚Äô says Libby. ‚ÄòIt had
been renovated 12 years before, but we wanted
to bring it up to date and make it our own.‚Äô
The couple, who have two children, decided
to convert the loft, coming up with a plan that
included a main bedroom with an en suite.
‚ÄòDesigning the best layout was key to the
room‚Äôs success and I couldn‚Äôt believe that a
bath and a shower would Ô¨Åt without looking
cramped,‚Äô says Libby. ‚ÄòBut that‚Äôs what we
achieved, thanks to a brilliant design company.‚Äô
Maximising space and light was key, so they
cleverly added extra height. ‚ÄòWe included a Ô¨Çat
skylight, which is recessed into the roof,‚Äô says
Libby. ‚ÄòThis drenches the room in light and
increases the head height, as it was formed with
an upstand higher than the rest of the ceiling.‚Äô
Keeping the d√©cor neutral has allowed Libby
to update the bathroom easily. ‚ÄòI can freshen
the look quickly by using different towels and
accessories,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI love our en suite ‚Äì
it‚Äôs a tranquil retreat from busy family life.‚Äô

enovating an entire house isn‚Äôt
for the faint-hearted, but John
Gregory and Paul Harris were
looking for a challenge. ‚ÄòWe
wanted to live in a house with
space to entertain guests and
a southwest-facing garden,‚Äô says John. ‚ÄòWhen
this place came up, it was perfect for us.‚Äô
During their Ô¨Årst three months living in the
house, the couple knocked two loft bedrooms
into one and raised the ceiling to create space for
a dressing room and a bathroom en suite to the
main bedroom. ‚ÄòWhile the work was being done,
we camped out in the loft with a few basic pieces
of furniture,‚Äô says John. ‚ÄòIt was a bit like having
a bedsit at the top of the house.‚Äô
With the newly designated area created, John
and Paul could plan their dream luxury space,
which included pale-grey marble tiles and
bespoke bathroom cabinets. ‚ÄòThe mirrored doors
are heated, so we never get condensation on
them,‚Äô says John. ‚ÄòWe also had an opaque glass
shower screen Ô¨Åtted that disappears into the wall
without any Ô¨Åxtures in the way. The marble was
cut on site at a 45Àö angle, so all the bevelled
edges Ô¨Åt together for an elegant Ô¨Ånish, with the
join between the wall and Ô¨Çoor looking seamless.

WHO LIVES HERE
John Gregory and Paul Harris.
WHAT THEY DID
The couple merged two rooms to create
a main bedroom with a dressing area

then we wouldn‚Äôt have to use
a floor mat outside the shower.

and wall-hung loo, and a dry area with
twin basins in a marble vanity unit

‚ñ†2 chamomile teabags ‚ñ†125g
powdered milk ‚ñ†80g oatmeal
‚ñ†90g bicarbonate of soda ‚ñ†A sprig 
of lavender ‚ñ†Clove oil or vanilla
essence ‚ñ† Glass jar ‚ñ† Label
1 Cut open the teabags and tip the
chamomile into a bowl. Mix in the
remaining dry ingredients, then add
drops of clove oil or vanilla essence
to your desired strength ‚Äì alternatively
add your favourite essential oil, such
as lavender to make a relaxing milk,
or lemongrass for an invigorating one. 
2 Pour the mixture into a glass jar
and label with the instructions to use
half a cup per bath, swirling it into
running warm water.
3 The bath milk will remain fresh for  
a couple of months.
‚ñ†Map ‚ñ†Cutting mat ‚ñ†Four cork
coasters (Darice coasters, ¬£2.79 for
four, Hobbycraft) ‚ñ†Craft knife ‚ñ†Foam
brushes (¬£1.89 for three, Royal &
Langnickel range, Amazon.co.uk,  
or DIY stores) ‚ñ† PVA glue
1 Unfold the map on a cutting mat, printed
side down, then place a coaster on top.
Cut out circles from the map by tracing
around the coaster with the craft knife.
2 Use the foam brush to apply glue to
one side of a coaster. Stick the map
circle to the coaster, printed side up,
smoothing to remove air bubbles.
Repeat the process for all the coasters.
3 Brush the tops and sides of all the
coasters with a thin layer of glue to
seal them, then dry completely before
putting them in a gift box.

‚ñ†Craft knife ‚ñ†Glass ‚ñ†Rubber gloves
‚ñ†Paintbrush ‚ñ†Etching cream (Armour

1 To make the stencil, print out your
chosen letter from one of the font
options on your computer in a size that
will fit the available space on your glass.
2 Place the printed-out letter onto a
sheet of self-adhesive vinyl on a cutting
mat. Secure it to the mat with sticky tape.
3 Cut out the letter shape using the craft
knife, pressing firmly enough to cut
through the paper and vinyl underneath.
Discard the cutout letter, so you are left
with the letter outline in the vinyl.
4 Peel off the backing sheet and position
the stencil onto the outside of the glass,
rubbing out air bubbles or creases.
5 Wearing rubber gloves, paint etching
cream onto the letter shape made by the
stencil. Leave for 10 minutes, rinse off the
cream and peel off the stencil. Wash the
glass with soap and water, then dry. Wrap
in tissue paper and pop in a gift box.
Find a vintage glass in a charity shop
or at a car-boot sale, or personalise a
basic one for the ideal wine lover‚Äôs gift.

Want to wax lyrical about food? Or enthuse about
interiors? Here‚Äôs how to get your thoughts online‚Ä¶
Try something new...
Q
WHAT IS A BLOG?
A blog is a website or web page
written by an individual or a small
team in a tone that‚Äôs quite chatty and
informal. Posts appear in reverse
chronological order, with the most
recent at the top. The majority of blogs
are interactive, so readers can leave
comments at the end of posts to
encourage further discussion.
Q
WHY DO IT?
Not only is a blog a great creative
outlet, providing the opportunity
to explore a passion for writing,
photography or whatever it is that fires
you up, but it can also help you find
and connect with like-minded people
online. The sense of community
among bloggers is strong ‚Äì tap into
that and you‚Äôll find people who will
inspire and support you. Blogging
conferences, such as Blogtacular
(blogtacular.com), provide the
means to meet these virtual friends
face-to-face, as well as offering you
advice and knowledge.
Q
WHAT TO BLOG ABOUT?
Some people treat their blog
like an online diary, while others focus
on a particular subject, such as food,
fashion, parenting, interiors or crafts.
You could use it to talk about your
family, your work ‚Äì something you‚Äôre
really passionate about. It‚Äôs important
to love the subject you choose to blog
about because this will come through
naturally in your posts, which is the
secret to attracting loyal readers.
Q
WHAT DO I DO FIRST?
You need to come up with a name
for your blog. Take your time with this
‚Äì it‚Äôs better to brainstorm and mull
over your ideas than to sprint off
with the first thing you think of and
possibly regret it later. This name
could be with you for years to come,  
so putting the initial effort into finding
something that feels right is well
worth it. Ideally, you want that magic
combination of something memorable
that also sums up what your blog is
about. If you can include a searchable
term to help lead people to your blog,
then that‚Äôs even better. Type your
possible names into a search engine
‚Äì you don‚Äôt want to pick something
that‚Äôs already out there. You can also
check if the domain name (web
address) is available on sites such
as 123-reg.co.uk or tsohost.com.
Q
WHAT NEXT?
So you know what you want to
blog about and you‚Äôve chosen your
name. Now you need a platform ‚Äì the
software or service that turns a regular
site into a functioning blog ‚Äì it‚Äôll do all
the technical stuff for you, so it doesn‚Äôt
matter if you aren‚Äôt a web genius.
There are a lot of platforms available
‚Äì some are free, such as Blogger or
WordPress.com, while some are
paid-for services, such as Squarespace.
The platforms also offer different
levels of customisation. What your
blog looks like is all down to your blog
template (also known as a ‚Äòtheme‚Äô).
Blogging platforms offer their own
range of templates, or you can buy
them elsewhere on sites such as Etsy,
Themeforest or Blogzilla.
Q
HOW DO I GET READERS?
Once you‚Äôve started producing
posts, you‚Äôll want people to read them.
Social-media platforms offer a great
way to invite an audience over to your
blog. There are so many platforms that
you can use, such as Twitter, Facebook,
Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, Vine,
you probably won‚Äôt be able to keep up
with them all. Choose a couple at first
to mention your blog and see how you
get on. Sharing your posts on your
Facebook page can be a good way to 
FEATURE HEATHER YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHS TIMEINCUKCONTENT.COM
introduce friends and family to
your blog. As well as sharing your
own content, be sure to share other
people‚Äôs, too. Your audience will
appreciate it, and it‚Äôs a key element
of being part of the blogging and
social-media community. It should
mean that other people will start
sharing your content, too.

FOR GREAT CHRISTMAS
SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS 
GIVE MORE ‚Äì AND GET
MORE ‚Äì THIS CHRISTMAS
Instead of dropping some coins into a charity collection box, consider 
a more inventive way to make life better for others this year
Charitable giving doesn‚Äôt have to be
a one-way street. These ideas involve
making an easy commitment, getting
involved and seeing the results of
your generosity in ways that will
enrich your life as well as others‚Äô.
SUPPORT A SOCIAL INCUBATOR
You can join with other people to
lend money ‚Äì from as little as ¬£15
‚Äì to entrepreneurs in developing
countries who want to set up their 
own micro-businesses.
Lendwithcare (lendwithcare.org)
is run by Care International, a social
development charity and provider of
micro-loans for small businesses in
developing countries. There are many
micro-projects to choose from in
countries around the world. When your
loan is repaid, you can withdraw the
money or lend it out again. You can
also buy a gift voucher to give to a
friend or family member as a present.
Buzzbnk (buzzbnk.org) is a
UK platform that supports social
entrepreneurs and innovators. Its
projects are as diverse as help for the
homeless, organic farming and a rugby
team for players with disabilities.
TRY CROWDFUNDING
Business start-ups have long raised
seed capital via crowdfunding ‚Äì
an alternative form of Ô¨Ånance that
involves contributions from a large
number of people, usually through the
internet. Now you can use the power
of crowdfunding to support an existing
charity, or to fund an appeal or
charitable cause that you have set up.
JustGiving (justgiving.com) is an
online social platform for giving; it
now has a crowdfunding option where
anyone can raise money for a local  
or overseas community.
GlobalGiving (globalgiving.co.uk)
enables you to search for a project ‚Äì for
FEATURE MARIANNE CURPHEY PHOTOGRAPHS SIMON WHITMORE,
LIVING4MEDIA/CULTURA ILLUSTRATIONS EMMA JACKSON
example, the education of children
who can‚Äôt afford to go to school ‚Äì
and make a donation towards it.
Razoo (razoo.com) helps you to
crowdfund your own project or support
hundreds of existing charity projects
around the world, from animal rescue
to environmental concerns.
MAKE IT PERSONAL
Give peer-to-peer The appeal of
P2P charities is that the money you
lend goes directly to the person
making the appeal, so you can see
evidence of how your loan is making
a difference. The best known is Kiva
(kiva.org), which connects lenders
to people on low incomes around the
world and aims to help them work
their way out of poverty. GlobalGiving
(globalgiving.co.uk) also supports
projects in developing countries.
Sponsor a child through World
Vision (worldvision.org.uk) and
ActionAid (actionaid.org.uk) ‚Äì both of
which enable donors to connect with
and sponsor a child in an impoverished
community. You will receive updates
and letters from your chosen child, and
the money you send beneÔ¨Åts the whole
community in which that child lives.
GIVE AS YOU EARN, SHOP 
OR SELL ONLINE
Register with Care2Save (care2save.
co.uk) and you‚Äôll generate a commission
from the retailer each time you shop
online, splitting 80% towards your
chosen charity and 20% towards
Care2Save‚Äôs charitable work around
the world in palliative care. Just select
a charity you wish to support when you
sign up. The organisation, which is
supported by major retailers, such as
BT, Boots, House of Fraser and John
Lewis, is itself a registered charity.
Sell via eBay and you can arrange 
to donate up to 100% of the sale 
proceeds, plus Gift Aid if you are a
UK taxpayer, to your chosen good
cause. You list your item and select
your charity and a discount on your
selling fee. The item will be tagged
with a blue and yellow ribbon.
SacriÔ¨Åce some salary If your
employer, company or personal
pension provider runs a Payroll Giving
scheme, you can donate straight from
your wages or pension. This happens
before tax is deducted from your
income. Ask your employer or pension
provider if they run a Payroll Giving
scheme. The tax relief you get depends
on the rate of tax you pay.
HAND OVER AN ASSET
You don‚Äôt have to pay tax on land,
property or shares you donate to
charity. You must keep records of
the donation to show that you‚Äôve
made the gift or sale, and that the
charity has accepted it. When you
offer a gift of land, property or shares,
the charity may ask you to sell the
gift on its behalf. You can do this
and still claim tax relief for the
donation, but you must keep records
of the gift and the charity‚Äôs request.

VARIETIES TO TRY 
Plant bare-rooted and container-grown trees this
month to bring structure, height and wildlife into
your garden. November to March is the dormant
season and, providing the ground hasn‚Äôt frozen
over, this is the ideal time for planting.
Choose from bare-rooted or
pricier container-grown species.
If it‚Äôs the latter, ensure the tree
is well established in its pot.
I prefer planting in a square
hole, so roots grow into corners
rather than in a circle. It‚Äôs vital to
match the depth of the original
pot, mix in a little compost when
planting and finish with mulch.
Aid irrigation during dry
summer months by coiling a
section of perforated drainage
pipe around the root ball,
to deliver water directly.
Stake at about 60cm above
the ground to support the
tree for the first two years.

Hamamelis mollis ‚ÄòImperialis‚Äô
These beautifully scented,
deciduous shrubs are part of
the witch hazel family, and are
a delight in the winter garden
when colour is scarce. Their
velvety flowers come in gold,
orange and red, bloom for
up to five weeks and are frost
resistant. Bring a few stems
indoors for a striking feature.
HOW TO GROW Multi-stemmed
and up to 5m high, these shrubs are
hardy, maintenance free and need
little pruning. Plant where you can
enjoy the fragrance, such as lining a
path or border, or in a confined space.
They enjoy neutral to slightly acidic,
free-draining soil in an open, sunny
patch ‚Äì just ensure young plants are
protected by avoiding exposed spots.
The only downside is that you need
to be patient, as they can take up to
three or four years to hit their stride.
With its stunning
yellow, red and gold
hues, witch hazel
makes a striking
and fragrant
winter display

new home for

MANIFESTO
I believe that
tech should...
‚óèMake your life easier 
‚óèBe super-simple 
to use
‚óèStand the test of time 
‚óèLook good and
work brilliantly
WHY WE LOVE THEM‚Ä¶ Promised
yourself you‚Äôd start eating breakfast or
stop spending so much on lunch? Then
you need a blender that can blitz up
a single smoothie or even a serving of
soup in seconds. Best of all, they can
do the job in a cup you take away with
you, so there‚Äôs no messy decanting or
extra washing up. If your mornings are
chaotic, prep your ingredients the night
before, put them into the blending
beaker and pop it in the fridge. The
next day, just grab the beaker, blitz the 
contents, add a lid and you‚Äôre ready
to go. I throw in a couple of ice cubes
before blending, so my oaty breakfast
smoothie stays cold on the commute
‚Äì if you want to do the same, choose
a machine that‚Äôs designed to crush ice.
PRODUCTS WE LOVE‚Ä¶ Basic models,
such as Breville‚Äôs, are great for making
smoothies and shakes, while powerful
machines cost more, but pay you back
in versatility. The top-of-the-range
Vitamix, for example, can make dips,
sauces and soups, as well as drinks.
Save money, get healthy or just become really good
at making cocktails with these pint-sized drinks makers

Extra oven space
It‚Äôs not just fridge space that‚Äôs precious at
Christmas ‚Äì your oven and hob are likely
to be feeling the strain, too. One way to
take the heat off is to get yourself a bit
on the side‚Ä¶ like Hotpoint‚Äôs latest
microwave. Capable of far more than
merely heating up leftovers, this combi
model has a Steam & Boil mode for
vegetables, a Crisp function that will
come in handy for hot mince pies and
Multiwave technology that lets you cook
anything you would in a conventional
oven ‚Äì including the turkey ‚Äì but in less

Flexible spaces I‚Äôm currently
panicking about how I‚Äôm going to
fit the ingredients for Christmas dinner
for 12 people inside my fridge ‚Äì so if
only I had this beauty. Its freezer can
be converted into a 0ÀöC zone for meat
or a full-on fridge in under two hours.
All I‚Äôd need to do is ditch the peas and
a half-eaten tub of ice cream (how long
has it been in there?), and load the lower
part with my turkey and trimmings.
2
Clever storage The freezer‚Äôs XXL
drawer is big enough for a huge
bird or several pizzas, the Multibox is
designed to store butter and cheese, and
there‚Äôs a metal rack to keep bottles neat
and tidy while freeing up shelf space.
3
An ultra-fast freezing compartment
A combination of technologies works 
hard to keep your food fresh, like the
ultra-fast freezing compartment designed
to seal in food‚Äôs nutrients, or the
humidity-controlled vegetable drawer
that will keep wimpy salad items, such
as tomatoes, fresher for days longer.
4
Smart technology The fridge
analyses your habits and can
eventually predict when you‚Äôre going
to open the door. Then, just before you
do, it will decrease the temperature by
a couple of degrees so your food isn‚Äôt
affected by the sudden blast of warm air,
which could cause it to perish sooner.

Control and protect your home from anywhere
with a worry-free Wi-Fi security system 
Girl About Tech explains‚Ä¶
WHAT IS IT? As you‚Äôve leafed
through this month‚Äôs issue, no doubt
you‚Äôve been thinking about ways that
you can make your home even more
special, which suggests you‚Äôre just as
keen to keep it safe ‚Äì and that‚Äôs where
a few Wi-Fi gadgets can help. From
cameras that send you a live feed
of your living room to sensors that
message you if they detect a leak, this
tech takes just a couple of minutes to
set up, but will give you peace of mind
24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
WHY DO I NEED IT? Maybe
you‚Äôre going away on holiday and
want a system that will keep an eye
on the place and turn the lights on at
dusk and off at bedtime, or perhaps
you‚Äôd just like to know the kids have
got home safely from school. There are
gadgets that will let you do all this and
more, and they won‚Äôt cost you thousands
of pounds or need expert installation.
Standalone smart home devices,
such as cameras, can be controlled
independently and will send alerts
through the related app ‚Äì in most
cases, a device can have multiple
users, so your whole family can
access them. And there are a
growing number of hub-based
systems that allow you to control
multiple gadgets from one app
and create rules (see 4 and 5, right).
Importantly, the gadgets are really
easy to set up: just download
the companion app, power them
up and press a few buttons to
connect your gadgets to your
Wi-Fi. Here‚Äôs just a flavour of what
you can install and how it can all
keep you safe and in control‚Ä¶

SENSORS
‚ÄòContact‚Äô sensors send an
alert to your phone when
someone opens a window
or closes a door, so you‚Äôll
know the kids are home
from school, for example.
Moisture sensors detect
leaks, and motion sensors
will tell you if the dog or,
far worse, a burglar gets
into your bedroom.
FIT KEYLESS
LOCKS
Always losing keys? With Yale‚Äôs
keyless locks, you can gain
entry by typing in a PIN code or ‚Äì if it‚Äôs
hooked up to a Samsung SmartThings
hub ‚Äì with your smartphone. Then, if the
kids have been locked out, you can let
them in remotely, and if you think you‚Äôve
left the house unlocked, just check and
lock up with the app. You can also set up
PINs that expire or only work at certain
times of day, and give them to a cleaner
or visiting family instead of a spare key.

SET UP
CAMERAS
Wi-Fi cameras give a wide-angle
view of what‚Äôs happening at home
24/7, which you can see from an app on
your phone. They‚Äôll also record footage of
unusual activity triggered by movement
or noise, and send an alert so you can
act immediately, as it‚Äôs happening.
How much you‚Äôll be able to record
(and how much it costs) varies, but
most systems will give you some free
recordings, which are held securely in
the cloud for a few days to give you the
chance to download them. Some cameras
have two-way microphones, so if you have
one Ô¨Åtted at the front door and a postman
arrives with a parcel, you‚Äôll be able to tell them
where to leave it. Alternatively, if there‚Äôs one in the
kitchen and you‚Äôre at the shops wondering whether
you need to buy milk, you can ask whoever‚Äôs at home! 
SET UP RULES
Once your gadgets can talk
to each other via a hub, it‚Äôs
possible to set up rules, so that
if the system detects one thing,
it does another. For example, if
a Samsung SmartThings motion
sensor spots you‚Äôve arrived
home, it can turn on Lifx
lightbulbs and your Bose stereo.
Or if a Nest Protect detects
smoke or carbon monoxide, it can
tell your Philips Hue lightbulbs to
Ô¨Çash red ‚Äì useful if anyone at home
is hard of hearing. Just ensure that the
gadgets are compatible with your hub
and visible in your hub‚Äôs app.

Enjoy the special touch that candles add to your home, but take care to use them safely:
Always place lit candles well away from foliage, furniture, curtains and soft furnishings,
and always out of draughts
Keep candles out of reach of children and pets
 Never leave 
a burning candle unattended
Keep candles away from hair and clothing  
Always place candles upright in suitable holders that can‚Äôt easily
fall over
 Always be sure that candles are properly extinguished
BE
CANDLE
