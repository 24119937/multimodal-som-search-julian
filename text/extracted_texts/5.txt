Abstract
This study tests a path model in which residential satisfaction, operationalized in terms of multidimensional
perceived residential environment quality (PREQ), predicts neighbourhood attachment considered as the ¢nal
criterion. Socio-demographic (age, sex, socio-economic level) and residential (length of residence both in the
neighbourhood and in Rome, number of persons living together) variables are also included in the theoretical
model as predictors of both PREQ and neighbourhood attachment. Using a multidimensional questionnaire
for the measurement of PREQ and a unidimensional scale for the measurement of neighbourhood attachment,
the study focuses on a sample of 497 inhabitants from 20 di¡erent neighbourhoods in the city of Rome. The
multidimensional PREQ questionnaire comprises 20 di¡erent scales covering four main areas: architectural
and town-planning features (six scales); social relations features (three scales); punctual and in-network ser-
vices (six scales); context features (¢ve scales). First, the path model is tested separately in each area using
structural equation analysis. Then, the best predictors emerging from each area, together with all socio-demo-
graphic and residential variables, are included in a ¢nal model. This model shows both the relevance of pre-
dictors from all four areas in predicting attachment, and also a hierarchy between the areas in the power of
the prediction (context area giving the most powerful predictors, services giving the weakest ones, architec-
tural and town-planning, and social relations having intermediate importance). Length of residence in the
neighbourhood and socio-economic level are the most relevant of the residential and socio-demographic vari-
ables. Results are discussed with reference to the multicomponential nature of the process of neighbourhood
attachment.

Introduction
The present work focuses on the relationship be-
tween inhabitants' perceptions of residential quality
concerning di¡erent aspects of their neighbour-
hood,
and
attachment
to
the
neighbourhood.
In particular,
the
study aims
at
verifying
the
relevance of residential satisfaction, operational-
ized
in
terms
of
multidimensional
perception
of
residential
quality,
for
the
development
of attachment to one's own residential environment,
in a large urban environment such as the city of
Rome.
Both residential satisfaction and residential at-
tachment are considered as important constructs
in
environmental
psychology
(e.g. Tognoli, 1987;
Altman & Low, 1992; Sundstrom et al., 1996). Both
are founded on a relevant tradition of theoretical
considerations and empirical research aimed at
clarifying the relationship between people and their
residential environment (whether considered at the
level of the home, the neighbourhood, or the city).
However, the two constructs have seldom been
considered as mutually relevant and, particularly,
the theoretical and empirical links between the
two have never been approached in a systematic
way. Some of the relevant aspects of both residential
satisfaction and residential attachment will be re-
viewed brie£y in order to clarify the background
for the speci¢c hypothesis of the present work. We
will focus on residential environment at a medium
level (i.e., the neighbourhood), rather than at the

level of smaller or larger scale places (e.g., the home
or the city).2
The problem of satisfaction with and perception
of residential environment ö and speci¢cally with
the neighbourhood ö is one of the most traditional
topics in environmental psychology (e.g. Carp &
Carp, 1982; Fried, 1982; Canter, 1983; Fried, 1984;
Altman
&
Wandersman,
1987;
Tognoli,
1987;
Francescato et al., 1989; Carvalho et al., 1997; Garcia-
Mira et al., 1997; for a brief review of recent works,
see Sundstrom
et al., 1996). However, as other
authors (e.g. Weidemann & Anderson, 1985) have
noted, traditionally this topic has been character-
ized by: (1) attention to very speci¢c and fragmented
aspects of the residential environment, e.g. the ten-
dency to contrast spatial^physical aspects with so-
cial^relational ones; and (2) neglect of the temporal
and a¡ective component of the residential experi-
ence.
These tendencies are explicitly criticized by the
`transactional and contextual approach' to environ-
mental psychology (Altman & Rogo¡, 1987; Stokols,
1987), which stresses the following two points: (1) fo-
cusing on molar units of analysis such as `place'
when
studying
people^environment
transactions
(e.g. Canter, 1977; Stokols & Shumaker, 1981; Russell
& Ward, 1982; Proshansky et al., 1983; Holahan, 1985;
Altman, 1986; Moore, 1987); and (2) recognizing the
important role played by a¡ective and temporal di-
mensions in the environmental experience, as a con-
stitutive element of the person^place transactional
unit (Rapaport, 1977; Stokols & Shumaker, 1981;
Rapaport, 1982; Werner et al., 1985; Altman & Rogo¡,
1987; Werner, 1987).
In a previous study (e.g. Bonnes, 1991; Bonnes
et al., 1991a, b), we attempted to reconcile these dif-
ferent emphases. For example, we paid attention to
the fact that residential satisfaction is a multidi-
mensional construct focusing on di¡erent speci¢c
aspects of a place (spatial features, human features,
functional features; similarly to other studies such
as in Canter, 1983), which became integrated at the
level of people's place-evaluation. We also showed
that residential satisfaction is signi¢cantly posi-
tively related to di¡erent aspects of people's tempor-
al experience in the residential place (both linear
time as length of residence in the neighbourhood,
and cyclic time as daily budget of time spent in the
neighbourhood). In another study (Bonnes et al.,
1997), we focused more on the issue of residential
satisfaction's multidimensionality, preparing a Resi-
dential Satisfaction Scale (RSS) articulated in 20 di-
mensions,
covering
speci¢c
aspects
of
spatial,
social, functional, and contextual features. In that
instrument, residential satisfaction was operationa-
lized in terms of a large set of very speci¢c items,
each one addressing a single feature of the neigh-
bourhood, rather than directly asking for a single
general evaluation of satisfaction with the neigh-
bourhood. Thus, compared to other studies (e.g.
Ame¨ rigo & Aragone¨ s, 1990), our operationalization
of residential satisfaction was aimed at measuring
subjects' perception of their residential environment
(i.e. subjective indicators of urban quality), rather
than measuring global residential satisfaction (e.g.
`How satis¢ed are you with your neighbourhood?' or
`How would you de¢ne your neighbourhood as a
place to live?').
As far as studies of residential attachment are
concerned, `research is increasingly focused on psy-
chological attachment to places, often in the context
of home and neighbourhood' (Sundstrom et al., 1996,
p. 493). Residential or place attachment has become
a central construct for environmental psychology
during recent years, attracting a number of contri-
butions (e.g. Fried, 1982; Giuliani, 1991; Altman &
Low, 1992; Giuliani & Feldman, 1993; Feldman,
1996; Twigger-Ross & Uzzell, 1996). The aim is to un-
derstand the way people establish a¡ective bonds
with speci¢c places of their residential environ-
ment, which can become a part of their place iden-
tity (Proshansky et al., 1983; Low & Altman, 1992).
Place attachment tends to involve willingness to
maintain spatial^physical stability as well as feel-
ings of `grief' (Fried, 1982), in the case of forced spa-
tial detachment from places; and, especially at the
beginning, this approach focused on the relation-
ship between attachment and residential mobility
(e.g. Feldman, 1990; Fuhrer et al., 1993). Several
authors
suggested
place
attachment
should
be
viewed as a set of related phenomena, rather than
a singular phenomenon, as well as a phenomenon
strictly linked to such factors as time (Low &
Altman, 1992). Therefore, within a wider framework,
`place attachment involves positively experienced
bonds,
sometimes
occurring
without
awareness,
that are developed over time from the behavioural,
a¡ective, and cognitive ties between individuals
and/or groups and their socio-physical environment.
These bonds provide a framework for both indivi-
dual and communal aspects of identity and have
both stabilizing and dynamic features' (Brown &
Perkins, 1992, p. 284). Altman and Ginat (1992)
stressed place attachment research can adopt di¡er-
ent de¢nitions, all equally important, for example,
in terms of `process' or `outcome'. Outcome de¢ni-
tions refer to abstractions and feelings about the
environment (i.e. feeling attached); while process
332
M. Bonaiuto et al.
de¢nitions refer to social and/or psychological pro-
cesses occuring between the person and the place
(i.e. reasons for attachment).
Following this theoretical perspective, in a pre-
vious study (Bonnes et al., 1997), we created a neigh-
bourhood
attachment
scale
(NAS)
comprising
di¡erent aspects, i.e. inhabitants' desires to not
change their present residential place and to posi-
tively evaluate it, as well as their feelings of a¡ec-
tive bonds toward their neighbourhood and the
relevance of the residential place for the person's
identity. In this sense, such a scale can be consid-
ered to tap both outcome (items 127, 130, 131, 132 in
Appendix 2) and process (items 128 and 129 in
Appendix 2) de¢nitions of place attachment. How-
ever, empirical results (Bonnes et al., 1997) showed
such a measure of place attachment to work as a
unidimensional construct.3 Thus, while theoreti-
cally we can agree to conceive neighbourhood at-
tachment
as
a
multidimensional
construct,
empirically we think better instruments are still
needed in order to be able to properly measure such
a multidimensional character of the construct.
Therefore, research has been dedicated both to
residential satisfaction in terms of perceived resi-
dential environment quality and to neighbourhood
attachment; however, the links between the two con-
structs have scarcely received any empirical atten-
tion in environmental psychology. An exception is
o¡ered by a study by Ame¨ rigo and Aragone¨ s' (1990)
carried out on a sample of women living in council
housing in Madrid. Their results show that global
evaluations of residential satisfaction are related to
both neighbourhood attachment and perception of
speci¢c features of the residential environment (so-
cial, spatial, and functional features). Recently, on a
slightly di¡erent parallel line, Harris et al. (1996)
showed the ease of privacy regulation within one's
own family's home can enhance home attachment,
via the enhancement of both the quality of family
interactions and the sense of control in the home.
However, some kind of tie between residential
satisfaction or perceived residential environment
quality and attachment is generally accepted (e.g.
Sundstrom et al., 1996, pp. 491, 492, 493). The recipro-
cal relevance of these constructs should have speci-
¢c psychological signi¢cance because it represents a
link between two di¡erent levels of people's psycho-
logical experience of residential places. In fact, on
the one hand, perceived residential environment
quality traditionally focused more on problems of
perception of speci¢c aspects of urban environmen-
tal quality; on the other hand, residential attach-
ment traditionally focused more on molar aspects
of the person^environment relationship. Moreover,
while the ¢rst tradition tends to work at the level
of people's perceptions and cognitive evaluations of
the speci¢c items of the residential environment,
the second approach tends to study people's a¡ec-
tive bonds with their residential environment as a
whole.
Given the lack of empirical studies ö and particu-
larly of longitudinal ones ö addressing the relation-
ship between these two psychological aspects of
people^place transaction, it is di¤cult to establish
an a priori causal hypothesis between the two con-
structs. Obviously there are good theoretical rea-
sons
for
favouring
both
causal
directions.
For
example, as Ame¨ rigo and Aragone¨ s (1990) noted, re-
sidential satisfaction itself has sometimes been con-
sidered as a criterion with respect to residential
quality and other times as a predictor of moving or
other behaviours. Moreover, a circular and bidirec-
tional relationship between the two constructs can
easily be envisaged. However, due to practical con-
siderations, in this preliminary study perceived resi-
dential environment quality will be taken as the
predictor, and residential attachment as the criter-
ion. In fact, we conceptualize perceived residential
environment quality as a multidimensional con-
struct, articulated into many di¡erent speci¢c and
partly independent evaluative features. On the con-
trary, we de¢ne residential attachment in terms of a
unidimensional construct, referring to a global rela-
tionship of people's identity and a¡ective evalua-
tions with their residential environment. Therefore,
the objective is to discover which of the many di-
mensions of neighbourhood quality perception/satis-
faction are most relevant for the development of
inhabitants' neighbourhood attachment, taken as a
unique and ¢nal criterion synthesizing a general re-
levance of the place^neighbourhood for inhabitants'
place identity.
On this basis, we tested a path model in which
socio-demographic (gender, age, and socio-economic
level) and residential (number of persons living to-
gether, length of residence in the city, and length of
residence in the neighbourhood) variables are the
exogenous variables predicting perceived residential
environment quality indexes. These, in turn, predict
a neighbourhood attachment index considered as
the ¢nal criterion. The main aim was to verify the
relative predictive power of these di¡erent variables
for inhabitants' attachment to their neighbourhood
in order to test whether the development of strong
a¡ective bonds with the neighbourhood depend on
the perceived quality of particular features of the
residential environment (spatial, social, functional,
Perceived Residential Environment Quality and Neighbourhood Attachment
333
and contextual features), taking into account the re-
sidents' socio-demographic and residential experi-
ence characteristics. The speci¢c hypothesis is that
neighbourhood attachment, as a global a¡ective eva-
luation of inhabitants^residential place transaction,
can be predicted by a multidimensional set of vari-
ables, referring to di¡erent speci¢c domains of
neighbourhood urban quality. Therefore, socio-demo-
graphic and residential variables, although not spe-
ci¢cally relevant for the main hypothesis, were
included on the basis of previously quoted studies
showing their relevance both for perceived residen-
tial environment quality and attachment. However,
we expect perception of environmental quality vari-
ables would play the major role in predicting neigh-
bourhood
attachment,
mediating
the
role
of
classical socio-demographic and residential vari-
ables.
Method
Sample
All items were administered to a sample of 497
inhabitants living in 20 di¡erent neighbourhoods
in Rome. The de¢nition of neighbourhood was left up
to each respondent; in fact, the term used in the
items was `quartiere' (translated as `neighbourhood'
in
the
items
reported
in
Appendices
1
and 2). This is the usual, popular term used in
Italian
urban
toponomy,
even
if
it
does
not
necessarily correspond to the present administra-
tive
subdivision
of
Rome
(i.e.
`circoscrizione',
or district). Table 1 shows the sample breakdown
according
to
socio-demographic
and
residential
variables. A sample of about 25 residents was
selected in each neighbourhood. They had di¡erent
length of residence (from at least 4 years) and they
were equally subdivided according to sex and age.
The
various
neighbourhoods
(listed
in
Table 2 and represented in Figure 1) were chosen
in order to represent the maximum variety based
on their architectonic and town planning features,
population
density,
and
geographical
location
within the city area.
Tools and procedure
A
126-item
perceived
residential
environment
quality (PREQ) scale was used (for details on scale
construction and analysis, see RSS Bonnes et al.,
1997). Items refer to four general and 11 speci¢c
content areas derived from exploratory interviews
(see Appendix 1): architectural and town-planning
features: (1) architectural and town-planning space
(19 items), (2) organization of accessibility and
roads (14 items), (3) green areas (12 items). Social
relations features: (4) people and social relations
(22 items). Punctual and in-network (non punctual)
services: (5) punctual social-health-assistance ser-
vices (11 items), (6) punctual cultural-recreational
services (13 items), (7) punctual commercial ser-
vices
(5
items);
(8)
non-punctual
(in-network)
services (transportation, 5 items). Context features:
(9) lifestyle (7 items), (10) pollution (6 items), (11)
maintenance/care (12 items). The di¡erent number
of items in each content area matches the richer or
poorer articulation of each area, as observed in the
preliminary interviews. Content categories about
functional
facilities
(services)
match
analytic
categories used by urban-planners.
A 6-item neighbourhood attachment scale (NAS)
was also developed to measure the individual's de-
gree of attachment to the neighbourhood he/she is
living in (see Appendix 2). This scale mainly refers
to inhabitants' feelings of positive a¡ective orienta-
tion toward their neighbourhood and to their desire
to not change their present residential place; but it
also addresses the relevance of the place^neighbour-
hood for the person's identity. This scale was in-
tended to measure a unidimensional construct.
All items were prepared on small cards and pre-
sented to the respondent individually and in ran-
dom
order
by
the
interviewer. The
respondent
answered each item using a 4-point agreement^dis-
agreement scale. When necessary, item scores were
subsequently recoded so that high scores indicate
environment quality or neighbourhood attachment
for all items.
The following socio-demographic and residential
variables were also measured (see Table 1): age, sex,
socio-economic level (SEL), number of persons liv-
ing together (NPLT), length of residence in the
neighbourhood (LRN), and length of residence in
Rome (LRR). SEL was estimated by the interviewer
using a 4-point scale (low, medium-low, medium-
high, and high). Information about educational level
and occupation was also gathered, but was not used
in the analyses.
Measures
The ¢rst-order factor(s) underlying the items in
each one of the 11 conceptual domains of the
PREQ scale were identi¢ed through 11 ¢rst-order
Principal Component Analyses. In this way, 20
speci¢c
PREQ
indexes
were
derived. They are

A single ¢rst-order factor resulted from the Prin-
cipal Component Analysis carried out on NAS. All
6 items, referring to degree of individual attach-
ment to the neighbourhood lived in, loaded on one
factor (592% explained variance; a  086) labelled
`neighbourhood attachment'. Thus, a unidimensional
index of neighbourhood attachment was derived
(Table 3; for details on factor structure and factor
loadings, see Bonnes et al., 1997).
Levels for sex, age, estimated socio-economic level,
number of persons living together, length of resi-
dence in Rome, and length of residence in the neigh-
bourhood were measured as reported in Table 1.
Statistical analyses
Correlations matrices were preliminarily calculated
between
PREQ
indexes,
attachment
index,
and
socio-demographic and residential variables.
Links between socio-demographic variables, PREQ
indexes and the neighbourhood attachment index
were analysed using a path analysis model tested
by a structural equation approach and LISREL
(Bollen, 1989; Joreskog & Sorbom, 1993). Due to the
high number of variables and possible links in-
volved, we considered each of the four general areas
separately, i.e. architectural and town-planning fea-
tures, social relations features, punctual and non-
punctual (in-network) services, and context fea-
tures. In each of the four models taken separately,
socio-demographic variables predicted PREQ in-
dexes which, in turn, predicted the neighbourhood
attachment index. Thus, the aim of the theoretical
model was to predict people's neighbourhood attach-
ment on the basis of the degree of their neighbour-
hood PREQ. Finally, the PREQ indexes which were
the best predictors (path coe¤cient 5015) of neigh-
bourhood attachment in each general area, were se-
lected and included in a ¢nal model together with
all socio-demographic variables. This procedure is
conservative and it aims to preserve a good ratio
between number of subjects and estimated para-
meters (which is also of major concern when using
structrual equation models). One of the major fac-
tors negatively in£uencing the reliability of the
parameter estimates, and more generally a¡ecting
the ¢t of the model, is the estimation of a relatively
large number of parameters given the sample size
(Tanaka, 1987). The choice of including only the best
predictors for each area would dramatically reduce
the number of estimated parameters, therefore pro-
ducing more reliable values, everything else being
equal.4

GFI  096, CFI (Comparative Fit Index)  094.
Although Chi-Square (30)  3214 (p  00023), the
Critical n (n  42831) is close to the actual n of the
sample, therefore showing the goodness of the mod-
el. Two out of the three indicators of urban quality
play a signi¢cant role in predicting neighbourhood
attachment: threatening people (7033) and pre-
sence of social relationships (031). Together with
one residential and one socio-demographic variable
directly
predicting
neighbourhood
attachmentö
namely, length of residence in the neighbourhood
(020), estimated socio-economic level (7012)öthey
explain 25 per cent of the neighbourhood attach-

has no relevant in£uence on it.
Moreover,

(7014) and estimated socioeconomic level (70085).
LISREL for punctual and non-punctual (in-net-

GFI  086, CFI (Comparative Fit Index)  082, Chi-
Square (24)  14159 (p  00). Even the Critical n is
much lower than the actual sample size (n 15157),
therefore showing that the model is not a good

the

ple. Three out of the ¢ve indicators of urban quality
play a signi¢cant role in predicting neighbourhood
attachment: lack of opportunities (7037), quiet
(026), presence of micro-upkeep (015). Together with
two residential variables directly predicting neigh-
bourhood attachmentönamely, length of residence
in the neighbourhood (022), number of persons liv-
ing together (7010)öthey explain 34 per cent of
the neighbourhood attachment variance (r 2  034).
Pollution and lack of macro-upkeep have no relevant
in£uence on it.
Moreover,
lack

is
predicted
(r 2  0023) by length of residence in Rome (016)
and
length

From the above four models, ten residential satis-

(5015) of attachment: buildings' aesthetic pleasant-

lack of green areas for architectonic and town-plan-
ning features; threatening people and presence of
social relationships for social relations features; in-
adequacy of cultural activities and meeting-places

context features. Together with all residential and
socio-demographic variables they were included in
the ¢nal path analysis model (see Figure 6), which
shows excellent ¢t indexes: GFI (Goodness of Fit In-
dex)  099, adjusted GFI  097, CFI (Comparative
Fit Index)  099, Chi-Square (20)  2591 (p  017);
with a Critical n  72007. Six out of the ten indica-
tors of urban quality play a signi¢cant role in predicting
neighbourhood attachment: lack of opportunities
(7025), quiet (020), buildings' aesthetic pleasant-
ness (017), presence of social relationships (015),
lack of green areas (70084), inadequacy of cultural
activities and meeting places (70082). Together
with one socio-demographic and two residential
variablesölength of residence in the neighbourhood
(020), estimated socio-economic level (7012), and
number of persons living together (70084)öthey
explain 39 per cent of the neighbourhood attach-
ment variance (r 2  039).
Buildings' excessive and repetitive volume, threa-
tening people, inadequacy of sport services, and pre-
sence of micro-upkeep have no relevant in£uence on
it. As evident in Table 5, each of these four indica-
tors is somehow correlated with neighbourhood
attachment (7030, 7030, 7021, and 031 respec-
tively).
However,
their
correlations
with
other
stronger
predictors
of
the
same
criterion
can
account for their lack of signi¢cant relevance in
the ¢nal model.5
Moreover, in the ¢nal model, lack of opportunities
is predicted (r 2  0025) by length of residence in
Rome (015) and length of residence in the neigh-
bourhood (7015); quiet (r 2  0015) by length of resi-
dence
in
the
neighbourhood

Discussion
As far as residential and socio-demographic vari-
ables are concerned, although they showed several
direct signi¢cant paths on perceived urban quality
indicators, they showed only a few signi¢cant direct
paths on the neighbourhood attachment index.
Among residential variables, length of residence
in the neighbourhood was always a positive direct

predictor of neighbourhood attachment (in all ¢ve
tested models; 020 in the ¢nal one); while number
of persons living together was a negative direct pre-
dictor (though a weaker one) of neighbourhood at-
tachment (in the ¢rst, fourth and ¢nal models;
7008 in the ¢nal one), and length of residence in
Rome was never a signi¢cant direct predictor of
neighbourhood attachment.
Among
socio-demographic variables,
estimated
socio-economic level was the best direct predictor
of neighbourhood attachment (negatively in the
¢rst, second, third, and ¢nal model; 7012 in the ¢-
nal one); while age was a positive direct predictor of
neighbourhood attachment only in the third model
(7011), and gender was never a signi¢cant direct
predictor of neighbourhood attachment.
Thus, on the whole, neighbourhood attachment
tends to be higher especially with length of resi-
dence in the neighbourhood. To a lesser extent,
neighbourhood attachment also tends to be higher
for people living with few persons and for people
belonging to lower socio-economic levels. Neigh-
bourhood attachment tends also to be higher with
age. However, socio-demographic and residential
variables have other indirect in£uences on neigh-
bourhood attachment through the direct e¡ects
they exert on the various aspects of PREQ.
Length of residence in the neighbourhood and es-
timated socio-economic level showed a preeminent
role among residential and socio-demographic vari-
ables in predicting PREQ indexes, both in terms of
the pervasiveness (the range of variables they are
able to a¡ect) and magnitude (the power expressed
by their path coe¤cients) of their e¡ects.
Among residential variables, increasing length of
residence in the neighbourhood is positively asso-
ciated with perception of urban quality for volume,
external connections, opportunities; and it is nega-
tively associated with that pertaining to internal
practicability, quiet, and presence of micro-upkeep.
Length of residence in Rome is never positively as-
sociated with perception of urban quality; rather, it
is negatively associated with satisfaction with ex-
ternal connections, public transport services, op-
portunities, and macro-upkeep. Number of persons
living together is positively associated with percep-
tion of urban quality for macro-upkeep; and it is ne-
gatively associated with that pertaining to social
relationship, commercial assortment, and opportu-
nities.
Among
socio-demographic variables,
estimated
socio-economic level is positively associated with
the perception of urban quality for buildings' aes-
thetic pleasantness, green areas, internal practic-
ability, social threats, sport services, micro-upkeep,
and pollution; and it is negatively associated with
that pertaining to external connections. Age is posi-
tively associated with the perception of urban qual-
ity
for
buildings' aesthetic
pleasantness,
social
tolerance; and it is negatively associated with that
pertaining to micro-upkeep. Gender never a¡ects
perception of urban quality.
Overall, the main relationships that emerged re-
produce results typically found in environmental
psychology literature and
also in our
previous
studies (e.g., Carp & Carp, 1982; Carp, 1987; Bonnes
et al., 1991b, for age and length of residence; Bonnes
et al., 1991a, for socioeconomic level). Speci¢cally,
these results emphasize the role of length of resi-
dence in the neighbourhood both in terms of perva-
siveness and magnitude of e¡ects; in parallel, they
reduce the importance of other demographic predic-
tors, like age and gender, both in magnitude and
pervasiveness. In fact, most demographic predictors
have a weak direct relation with neighbourhood at-
tachment (see Table 4). This direct relation is gener-
ally even weaker when psychological variables are
included: PREQ indexes seem to mediate by and
large demographic predictors' relations with neigh-
bourhood attachment. A clear exception is length of
residence in neighbourhood: its relation with neigh-
bourhood attachment is not mediated by other vari-
ables. Therefore, from these results we can infer
that length of residence in the neighbourhood in£u-
ences attachment to that neighbourhood, irrespec-
tive of other evaluative aspects concerning the
same neighbourhood (e.g. quietness, lack of opportu-
nities).
On the other hand, perceived residential quality
indicators showed several signi¢cant direct e¡ects
on neighbourhood attachment.
In particular, the model involving architectural
and town-planning indicators o¡ers the best predic-
tion of people's neighbourhood attachment, which is
greater with buildings' aesthetic pleasantness, inter-
nal practicability, and external connections, and
smaller with buildings excessive and repetitive vo-
lume, and lack of green areas.
Then, the model involving indicators of context
features is a good predictor of neighbourhood at-
tachment, which is greater with quiet, and presence
of micro-upkeep, and smaller with lack of opportu-
nities.
The model involving indicators of social relations
features o¡ers a discrete prediction of people's
neighbourhood attachment, which is greater with
presence of social relationships, and smaller with
threatening people.
Perceived Residential Environment Quality and Neighbourhood Attachment
345
On the contrary, the model involving services in-
dicators does not globally ¢t with the data and pro-
vides
a
weak
prediction
of
neighbourhood
attachment, which is slightly greater with commer-
cial assortment, and adequacy of social and health
services, and is slightly smaller with inadequacy of
sport services, inadequacy of educational services,
and inadequacy of cultural activities and meeting
places.
The ¢nal model, which included the best predic-
tors of attachment emerging from the four previous
models, showed that each area is somehow impor-
tant in determining neighbourhood attachment. In
fact, the six predictors which emerged as signi¢cant
out of the best ten belong to the four di¡erent
areas: two from architectural and town-planning
features, one from social relations features, one
from services features, and two from contextual fea-
tures. That is, neighbourhood attachment is signi¢-
cantly
greater
with
quiet,
buildings'
aesthetic
pleasantness, and presence of social relationships,
and smaller with lack of opportunities, inadequacy
of cultural activities and meeting-places and lack
of green areas. This result underlines the composite
nature of neighbourhood attachment, con¢rming
our preliminary analyses of the various speci¢c resi-
dential facets which may be associated with a global
evaluation of the residential environment (see the
second-order factor analyis of RSS and NAS in
Bonnes et al., 1997). However, the ¢nal model also
clearly details di¡erences in the relative importance
of these indicators. In fact, context features play the
most relevant role: lack of opportunities and quiet in
the neighbourhood are the two most powerful pre-
dictors (7025 and 020 respectively). Then, two indi-
cators have a less powerful but still consistent
in£uence on neighbourhood attachment: buildings'
aesthetic pleasantness and presence of social rela-
tionships (017 and 015, respectively). Finally, two in-
dicators have weak predictive power: lack of green
areas and inadequacy of cultural activities and
meeting places (0084 and 0082 respectively). With
respect to neighbourhood attachment, context fea-
tures seem to contribute more; then, architectural
and town-planning features and social relations fea-
tures; service features play only a minor role. The
lack of signi¢cance of the other four indicators in-
cluded in the ¢nal model (i.e., buildings' excessive
and repetitive volume, threatening people, inade-
quacy of sport services, and presence of micro-up-
keep) seems due to their correlations with stronger
predictors of attachment.
Indicators of the perceived quality of architec-
tural, social, and contextual features emerge as
relevant predictors of neighbourhood attachment;
in comparison, service features seem less impor-
tant. On the one hand, the relative lack of impor-
tance of functional features with respect to the
neighbourhood attachment index should not be in-
terpreted as a general lack of relevance of these in-
dicators. Rather, they may prove to be relevant
predictors of other variables. On the other hand,
the inter-place perspective to explain inhabitants'
neighbourhood
activities
and
use
of
servicesö
pointed out in our previous studies on urban prag-
matics (e.g. Bonnes et al., 1990; Bonaiuto & Bonnes,
1996)öcan be taken into account here. In fact, most
neighbourhood residents are generally character-
ized by a multiplace system of activities, in which
they also use services and facilities located in other
parts of the city (i.e. the centre and periphery).
On the whole, the satisfying test of the ¢nal path
model con¢rmed the hypothesis of the study, stres-
sing the multicomponential nature of the process of
establishing positive a¡ective relationships with the
residential neighbourhood. The positive evaluation
of
di¡erent
aspects
of
the
residential
environ-
mentöas far as the contextual, architectural, social,
and service features are concernedöunderlies feel-
ings of neighbourhood attachment. Furthermore,
the variety of perceived residential environment qua-
lities, which resulted to be signi¢cant predictors of
neighbourhood attachment, suggests a multicompo-
nential nature of the process of place attachment.
This is somehow coherent with three main psycholo-
gical functions attributed to place attachment (e.g.
Fried, 1982; Altman & Low, 1992; Fuhrer et al.,
1993): regulation of personal/social identity, social
contact, and the regulation of emotions. Moreover,
these results shows that there are signi¢cant links
among two di¡erent levels of people environmental
experience (as usually theoretically stated; e.g. Sund-
strom et al., 1996, pp. 491^493): perceptions and cog-
nitive evaluations of speci¢c molecular aspects of
the neighbourhood, on the one side; and global a¡ec-
tive bonds with the same place, on the other side.
Therefore, they represent an empirical bridge which
¢lls the gap among two traditionally separated re-
search
areas
within
environmental
psychology;
namely, perceived residential environment quality
and residential satisfaction, on the one side, and
place attachment, on the other side.
In terms of more general interdisciplinary im-
plications, these results can represent guidelines
for orienting policies aimed to selectively intervene
on neighbourhood environmental features in order
to
foster
inhabitants' attachment
to
their
own
neighbourhood. However, such applied implications
346
M. Bonaiuto et al.
suggests an explicit causal direction from environ-
mental management, to perceived residential envir-
onment
quality
(or
residential
satisfaction),
to
neighbourhood attachment: while compatible with
the presented results, it would need to be empiri-
cally veri¢ed via a quasi-experimental research
design.

the International Workshop on Population and Environ-
ment in Developed Societies, C.N.R., Rome, 28^29 October,
1996; and at The British Psychological Society Social Psy-
chology Section Annual Conference 1997, University of
Sussex, 17^19 September, 1997 (Symposium: `Identity and
Place: Identifying Places and Locating Selves').
(2) This choice is primarily justi¢ed by the general re-
search project within which the present study is framed,
i.e. the U.N.E.S.C.O.-M.A.B. Rome Project, a pluridisci-
plinary research programme on urban systems which fo-
cused
particularly
on
neighbourhood
residential
environments
in the
city of Rome (Giacomini, 1981;
Bonnes, 1987, 1991, 1993). This multidisciplinary research
programme on the urban environment had two main
aims: (1) to increase knowledge and understanding of psy-
chological processes involved in the perception of urban
quality, particularly at the level of the neighbourhood; (2)
to develop knowledge and tools which might be useful for
other non-psychological disciplinary ¢elds (such as town-
planners,
plant
ecologists,
etc.)
participating
in
the
M.A.B.-Rome Project, in order to promote and achieve a
pluridisciplinary approach to the city (e.g. Bonnes & Bo-
naiuto, 1995).
(3) In a further study, as yet unpublished, we developed an
extended 16-item NAS, which comprises new and better
balanced items referring to rootedness and positive eva-
luations, as well as to a¡ective bonds, personal, and so-
cial identity. Principal component analysis shows again
all items are highly loaded in only one component, in a
very clear and reliable manner which psychometrically
supports a single construct solution, rather than a multi-
dimensional one.
(4) Moreover, when considering a given set of variables, a
variable which does not signi¢cantly a¡ect another vari-
able in general can only become even less important when
other variables are added to the starting set, except for
rare occasions when spurious e¡ects are present (see Ba-
gozzi & Baumgartner, 1994). In other words, if x1 is not
in£uencing y when considering x2, x3, and x4, it will not
increase its in£uence on y when we further include x5,
x6, and x7. Indeed, its in£uence on y will generally be
either equal or lower.
(5) In fact (see Table 5), buildings' excessive and repetitive
volume has medium correlations with buildings' aesthetic
pleasantness (7032) and lack of opportunities (037); and
it is slightly correlated with inadequacy of cultural activ-
ities and meeting places (018), quiet (7014), lack of green
areas (013), and presence of social relationships (7010). It
also correlates with some other non-signi¢cant predictors:
threatening people (031) and presence of micro-upkeep
(7021). Threatening people has strong correlations with
quiet
(7058)
and
buildings'
aesthetic
pleasantness
(7053); medium correlations with lack of green areas
(037); and it is slightly correlated with lack of opportu-
nities (021), and inadequacy of cultural activities and
meeting places (018). It also correlates with the other
non-signi¢cant
predictors:
presence
of
micro-upkeep
(7061), buildings' excessive and repetitive volume (031)
and inadequacy of sport services (024). Inadequacy of
sport services has strong correlations with lack of green
areas (067); medium correlations with buildings' aesthetic
pleasantness (034); and it is slightly correlated with lack
of opportunities (028) and quiet (7012). It also correlates
with the other non-signi¢cant predictors: threatening
people (024) and presence of micro-upkeep (7036). Pre-
sence of micro-upkeep has strong correlations with build-
ings' aesthetic pleasantness (061) and lack of green areas
(7052); medium correlations with quiet (036) and lack of
opportunities (7032); and it is slightly correlated with in-
adequacy of cultural activities and meeting places (7019)
and presence of social relationships (014). It also corre-
lates with the other non-signi¢cant predictors: threaten-
ing people (7061), inadequacy of sport services (7036)
and buildings' excessive and repetitive volume (7021).
