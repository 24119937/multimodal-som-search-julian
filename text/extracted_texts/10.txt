Introduction
The overall pace of society is accelerating, resulting in modern people being under various pressures 
for a long time, with great psychological pressure, resulting in anxiety and depression and worrying 
mental health. The study analysed the psychological stress of modern people and obtained six 
factors that led to modern people suffering from psychological diseases, including work pressure, 
emotional and family pressure, network dependence psychology, learning pressure, social 
development adaptation pressure and economic pressure (Yang & Department 2019). Among them, 
work pressure refers to that the pace of life and work of modern people are constantly accelerating, 
which is very obvious in urban white-collar groups (Schandert et al. 2021). Most white-collar groups 
are in a high-tension working state for a long time and lack of practice to adjust their body, spirit and 
psychology. In this case, many white-collar workers have negative symptoms such as anxiety, 
irritability and depression (Roberts et al. 2021). Maintaining a high-tension mental state for a long 
time will lead to physical dysfunction and various physical and mental diseases, which is also one 
of the important reasons for the frequent occurrence of mental diseases and psychological disorders 
in modern people (King et al. 2022). Emotional and family stress refer to the increasing frequency of 
emotional problems, marriage problems and family problems in contemporary society, and the 
resulting psychological problems also increase dramatically (Malyshev et al. 2020). 
The rapid acceleration of societal change has subjected contemporary individuals to prolonged 
periods of diverse pressures, leading to substantial psychological strain, resulting in anxiety, 
depression, and compromised mental well-being. Within this context, the home has evolved 
into a vital refuge for modern individuals, offering both physical and psychological respite. 
Through experimental intervention, this study examines two distinct residential groups: those 
adhering to traditional housing and those residing in characteristic folk houses, specifically 
Gannan Hakka architecture. Analysing the psychological state of contemporary individuals 
and integrating Gannan Hakka architectural elements into folk house design through a 
psychologically informed approach, this research aims to enhance residents’ aesthetic 
experiences and alleviate psychological distress. The study involved 120 volunteers with 
varying psychological stress levels, categorised into characteristic and traditional folk house 
groups. Psychological assessments evaluated stress, self-efficacy, and quality of life. Findings 
reveal significantly improved psychological well-being, self-efficacy, and quality of life among 
the characteristic residential group, affirming the benefits of Gannan Hakka architecture 
integration. This research underscores the importance of addressing modern individuals’ 
environmental needs and proposes the integration of Gannan Hakka cultural elements into 
residential design to enhance well-being. 
Contribution: This study demonstrates the application of Hakka culture in contemporary 
housing profoundly influences residents’ lives, enabling both relaxation and a deeper cultural 
connection. This integration facilitates a comprehensive understanding of Hakka culture, 
promoting its preservation. Notably recognised for hospitality and diligence, Hakka culture 
enhances individuals’ appreciation of tradition, fostering physical and mental rejuvenation. 
These findings offer valuable insights for practical theology scholars and practitioners 
exploring the impact of religious aspects on modern residential design from a psychological 
perspective.

Take love as an example. When you encounter lovelorn, you 
will experience an extremely painful emotional experience. 
You will feel sad because of your nostalgia, and there will be 
a serious psychological imbalance. As a result, many people 
suffer from psychological disorders and a series of 
psychological diseases, which have a very negative impact 
on their own health (Sindermann et al. 2020). Marriage is the 
foundation of a family. However, in modern society, because 
of the change of ideas, the divorce rate in China has increased 
year by year. In a survey, more than 70% of the people 
believed that the breakdown of marriage would cause 
psychological stress to themselves and harm their mental 
health (Cengiz et  al. 2019). This can fully explain that 
marriage changes will bring greater psychological pressure 
to modern people. Network dependence psychology refers 
to: for teenagers, their mental intelligence is not mature, 
their self-control is low and their dependence on the network 
is extremely serious. A considerable number of teenagers 
show strong interest in the Internet and regard it as a 
necessity in their life (Kneer et al. 2019). Proper and correct 
access to the Internet is beneficial to relaxing the mood and 
consulting learning materials, but excessive access to the 
Internet will damage the physical and mental health of 
teenagers, especially the large amount of junk information 
on the Internet, which will cause teenagers to suffer from 
various psychological diseases. However, spending a lot of 
time in games, online love and chatting every day will affect 
teenagers’ self-awareness and environmental cognition and 
even cause teenagers to suffer from split personality disorder 
(Hernández-Moreno et al. 2021). Learning pressure mainly 
appears in students, especially high school students. Because 
of the pressure of the college entrance examination, high 
school students live a repetitive life every day, with endless 
books and learning materials, and exams are also emerging 
in endlessly. However, students’ families, teachers and 
schools all have high expectations of them, which leads to 
high school students bearing greater psychological pressure 
(Gorman et al. 2021). When the test results are not ideal, the 
psychological pressure from families, schools, classmates, 
teachers and students themselves will rise sharply. When 
this pressure exists for a long time, it will lead to various 
psychological problems of students. Learning pressure often 
leads to students’ bad psychology, such as slow reaction, 
irritability, anxiety, fear and weariness, so it needs to be paid 
attention to. The adaptation pressure of social development 
refers to the fact that in the process of rapid social 
development, the society is constantly changing and some 
modern people do not adapt to social changes for various 
reasons. The maladjustment to society is reflected in various 
aspects. In modern society, new things, new technologies, 
new concepts and new words emerge in an endless stream. 
When social development deviates from people’s inherent 
cognition of society, people will have a sense of difference. 
When this sense of difference is too large, it will lead to a 
feeling of being abandoned by the society, resulting in 
loneliness and anxiety (Micoulaud-Franchi et  al. 2021). In 
addition, because of the rapid development of society, there 
are some people who cannot adapt their skills to modern 
society, resulting in anxiety and helplessness. All the above 
will lead to various psychological problems. Economic 
pressure means that in today’s highly developed economy, 
people’s desire for money is also increasing day by day. In 
addition, because of the existence of various financial 
products and services, most modern people are burdened 
with various loans, such as housing loans and car loans. In 
big cities, the cost of living is very high, coupled with 
entertainment costs, transportation costs, among others. 
Modern people have a lot of expenses and economic 
pressure. However, some people’s salary cannot bear these 
expenses, and they will have anxiety, depression and mental 
illness. Home is a person’s shelter and an important place 
for modern people to relax physically and mentally. A good 
residential design, where residents live, can alleviate 
psychological stress, thus releasing the negative emotions of 
residents. The Hakka ethnic group, one of the seven major 
ethnic groups of the Han nationality in China, mainly living 
in southern China, and its distribution areas include Jiangxi, 
Guangdong and Fujian. The Hakka family is an important 
part of the Han nationality. Although the Hakka  people 
have roughly the same life customs and cultural 
characteristics, through in-depth research, we can find 
that  the Hakka buildings in various regions have 
their own characteristics of development according to the 
environment. The origin of the Hakka family is Gannan, so 
the Hakka architecture in Gannan is the most representative 
and traditional. Gannan Hakka architecture mainly includes 
two forms, which are divided into hall and house 
combination and enclosure. 
The most mainstream residential building of Gannan Hakka 
people has high cultural value and historical practical value. 
Among them, the most mainstream residential building 
form  in Gannan is the combination of halls and houses, 
which  is widely distributed in the northeast of Gannan. 
The  enclosed houses in southern Jiangxi are different from 
the  enclosed round earth buildings in Fujian and the 
semi-enclosed dragon houses in northern Guangdong. Most 
of the enclosed houses in southern Jiangxi are square enclosed 
spaces, which have  strong defensive and certain anti-
encirclement and suppression capabilities during the years of 
social unrest. The residence combines the regional history of 
Gannan and the living habits of surrounding residents, 
reflecting the ideological and cultural, social outlook, and 
lifestyle of Gannan region. Therefore, the Hakka architecture 
in Gannan area contains rich ideological, cultural and historical 
information, which has a certain impact on the spiritual 
thoughts of the residents. The research analyses the existing 
relevant documents, news and reports to understand the 
historical and cultural background and construction methods 
of Gannan residential buildings and explore the important 
elements of Gannan residential buildings. With the 
development trend of modern urban culture, all regions are 
based on local customs and  develop regional culture. The 
research analyses the psychological situation of modern 
people and then integrates the elements of Gannan Hakka 
architecture into the design of folk houses based on design 
psychology, so as to deepen the aesthetic feelings of residents

and alleviate the psychological pressure of residents. In the 
design of residential buildings based on Gannan Hakka 
architecture, the integration of Gannan Hakka elements 
greatly alleviates the psychological pressure of residents. 
Introducing ethnic elements into modern urban architectural 
clusters has a certain degree of innovation.
Subjects and methods
Study setting
The psychological problems of modern people are becoming 
more and more serious and frequent, which has greatly 
hindered social progress and reduced the happiness of 
Chinese residents. In various surveys, more than half of 
modern people have varying degrees of psychological stress, 
and more than 26% of modern people suffer from various 
types of psychological diseases. There are seven common 
psychological problems in modern people, including 
depression, compulsion, anxiety, division, social fear, choice 
difficulty and habitual negation. Depressive psychology is 
mainly reflected in the fact that individuals lose interest in the 
things and people around them and think that life is boring. 
Compulsive psychology refers to the fact that an unimportant 
thing must be completed according to one’s own requirements. 
Anxiety refers to feeling nervous and anxious about anything 
and problems, and sweating and trembling will occur. Split 
psychology refers to people who are extroverted, warm and 
cheerful when facing familiar people, but they are unwilling 
or afraid to communicate with strangers, and their emotions 
are capricious. Social phobia means that some people are 
afraid of people and things outside and refuse to communicate. 
Selection difficulty refers to that some people often feel that 
their choice is not the best choice when facing choices and 
show panic and anxiety in the scene where they must make 
choices. Habitual negative psychology refers to people who 
habitually deny themselves and others, who often only see 
the defects of things, so they often take a pessimistic attitude 
towards things. As the main place for modern people to relax, 
the social intercourse of folk houses is also very important. 
Good residential design can relax the mood of residents, give 
residents comfort from visual and other sensory experience 
and use experience and alleviate residents’ negative emotions. 
Therefore, based on the design psychology, the research 
analyses the needs of modern people for the living 
environment and proposes to integrate the elements of 
Gannan Hakka architecture into the design of folk houses, so 
as to deepen the aesthetic feelings of residents and alleviate 
the psychological pressure of residents.
Design
In order to verify the relieving effect of integrating the 
elements of Gannan Hakka architecture into the residential 
design on the psychological pressure of modern people, a 
control experiment was designed. Through Internet, group 
chat, offline leaflets and other ways, 120 volunteers were 
recruited for the experiment. All volunteers had different 
levels of psychological stress. All volunteers were numbered 
and then randomly grouped using Excel software. After 
obtaining the grouping results, all volunteers were divided 
into two groups, namely, the characteristic folk house group 
and the traditional folk house group. For the members of the 
characteristic folk house group, let them live in the folk 
houses with the elements of Hakka architecture in southern 
Jiangxi for half a month; for members of the traditional 
residential group, they shall be allowed to live in the ordinary 
residential for half a month. Half a month later, the 
psychological stress, self-efficacy and quality of life of the 
two groups were evaluated by psychological test scale. 
The psychological stress, self-efficacy and quality of life of 
volunteers were evaluated by symptom checklist 90 
(SCL-90), self-efficacy evaluation scale (SEES) and SF-36. 
Self-efficacy evaluation  includes four aspects: stress self-
management, anxiety self-management, depression self-
management and emotional self-management. The total 
score of the SEES is calculated as shown in Equation 1:
F = S + A + D + E
[Eqn 1]
In Equation 1, S, A, D, and E respectively represent stress self-
score, anxiety self-score, depression self-management score, 
and emotional self-management score.
Results
Symptom checklist 90 was used to evaluate the psychological 
stress of the two groups of volunteers. The four dimensions 
of anxiety, depression, hostility and neuroticism in the scale 
were selected to evaluate the psychological situation of 
volunteers. 
See Table 1 for relevant information of the two groups of 
volunteers. In Table 1, we can see that there are 10 members 
under the age of 20 in the characteristic residential group 
and eight members under the age of 20 in the traditional 
residential group. The difference between the two groups is 
very small, and the P-value of the difference is greater 
than  0.05; there are 29 members aged 20–30 years in the 
characteristic residential group, and 30 members aged 20–30 
years in the traditional residential group. There is a very 
small difference between the two groups, and the P-value of 
the difference is greater than 0.05; there are 21 members 
aged over 31 years in the characteristic residential group, 
and 22 members aged over 31 years in the traditional 
residential group. There is a very small difference between 
the two groups, and the P-value of the difference is greater 
than 0.05. It can be seen that in terms of age, the difference 
between the characteristic residential group and the 
traditional residential group is very small, and the p-value 
of the difference is greater than 0.05. In addition, in terms of 
psychological stress, education level and occupational 
distribution, the difference between the characteristic 
residential group and the traditional residential group is 
also very small, with a P-value greater than 0.05. The above 
results show that the difference between the characteristic 
residential group and the traditional residential group is 
very small, which can be used as a comparative comparison 
of the experiment.

During the experiment, the changes of psychological pressure 
of the two groups of volunteers are shown in Table 2.
In Table 2, before the experiment, the scores of the two 
groups of volunteers in the four dimensions of anxiety, 
depression, hostility and neuroticism were basically the 
same; after the experiment, the scores of the members of 
the characteristic residential group in the four dimensions 
of anxiety, depression, hostility and neuroticism decreased 
significantly, while the scores of the members of the 
traditional residential group in the four dimensions of 
anxiety, depression, hostility and neuroticism changed 
little. It can be seen that before the experimental 
intervention, the members of the characteristic residential 
group scored 1.74 ± 0.44 in the anxiety dimension, while 
the members of the traditional residential group scored 
1.75 ± 0.47 in the anxiety dimension. The score difference 
between the two groups was very small, and the significance 
was greater than 0.05. The score of the members of the 
characteristic residential group in the depression dimension 
was 1.93 ± 0.35, and the score of the members of the 
traditional residential group in the depression dimension 
was 1.88 ± 0.42. The score difference between the two 
groups was very small, and the significance was greater 
than 0.05. The score of the members of the characteristic 
residential group in the hostile dimension is 1.96 ± 0.62, 
while the score of the members of the traditional residential 
group in the hostile dimension is 1.86 ± 0.71. The  score 
difference between the two groups is very small, and the 
significance is greater than 0.05.
The score of neuroticism dimension of the members of the 
characteristic residential group was 1.62 ± 0.49, and that of 
the traditional residential group was 1.61 ± 0.54. The 
difference between the two groups was very small, and the 
significance was greater than 0.05. After the experiment, the 
score of the members of the characteristic residential group in 
the depression dimension was 1.35 ± 0.26, which was 
significantly lower than that before the experiment, with a 
difference of less than 0.05. The score of the members of the 
traditional residential group in the depression dimension 
was 1.91 ± 0.38, which was not significantly different from 
that before the experiment, with a difference of more than 
0.05. The score of the members of the characteristic residential 
group in the depression dimension was significantly lower 
than that of the traditional residential group, with a difference 
of less than 0.05. After the experiment, the score of the 
members of the characteristic residential group in the hostile 
dimension was 1.45 ± 0.45, which was significantly lower 
than that before the experiment, with a difference of less than 
0.05. The score of the members of the traditional residential 
group in the hostile dimension was 1.88 ± 0.63, which was 
not significantly different from that before the experiment, 
with a difference of more than 0.05. The score of the 
characteristic residential group in the hostile dimension was 
significantly lower than that of the traditional residential 
group, with a difference of less than 0.05. After the experiment, 
the score of neuroticism dimension of the members of the 
characteristic residential group was 1.40 ± 0.33, which was 
significantly lower than that before the experiment, with a 
difference of less than 0.05. The score of neuroticism 
dimension of the members of the traditional residential 
group was 1.58 ± 0.43, which was not significantly different 
from that before the experiment, with a difference of more 
than 0.05. The score of neuroticism dimension of the members 
of the characteristic residential group was significantly lower 
than that of the traditional residential group, with a difference 
of less than 0.05. Table 3 shows the changes of SF-36 scores of 
the members of the characteristic residential group and the 
members of the traditional residential group.
In Table 3, after the experiment, the scores of physical function, 
social function, role function and emotional function of the 
members of the characteristic folk house group in the SF-36 
scale are significantly higher than those of the members of the 
traditional folk house group. Using SEE to evaluate the self-
efficacy of the members of the characteristic residential group 
and the traditional residential group. After the experimental 
intervention, the score of the members of the characteristic 
residential group in the physical function dimension was 71.25 
± 9.64, and the score of the members of the traditional 
residential group in the physical function dimension was 66.84 
± 9.02. The score of the members of the characteristic residential 
group in the physical function dimension was significantly 
lower than that of the traditional residential group, with a

significance of less than 0.05. After the experimental 
intervention, the score of the members of the characteristic 
residential group in the social function dimension was 
69.04 ± 8.02, and the score of the members of the traditional 
residential group in the social function dimension was 65.37 ± 
9.18. The score of the members of the characteristic residential 
group in the social function dimension was significantly lower 
than that of the traditional residential group, with a significance 
of less than 0.05. After the experimental intervention, the score 
of the members of the characteristic residential group in the 
role function dimension was 79.53 ± 7.46, and the score of the 
members of the traditional residential group in the role 
function dimension was 71.25 ± 9.52. The score of the members 
of the characteristic residential group in the role function 
dimension was significantly lower than that of the traditional 
residential group, with a significance of less than 0.05. After 
the experimental intervention, using different parameters, the 
emotional function scores of members of the characteristic 
residential group were 72.30 ± 8.48 and 74.39 ± 7.27, while the 
emotional function scores of members of the traditional 
residential group were 65.12 ± 9.03 and 68.52 ± 11.36. The score 
of the role function dimension of members of characteristic 
residential groups is significantly lower than that of traditional 
residential groups, with a significance of less than 0.05. After 
the experiment, the SEES scores of the members of the 
characteristic folk house group and the members of the 
traditional folk house group are shown in Table 4.
In Table 4, after the experiment, the scores of the members of 
the characteristic residential group in the four dimensions of 
stress self-management, anxiety self-management, depression 
self-management and emotional self-management in the 
SEES scale are significantly higher than those of the members 
of the traditional residential group. To sum up, based on 
the design psychology, the integration of Gannan Hakka 
architectural elements into the residential design can 
effectively relieve the psychological pressure of residents.
Discussion
The psychological problems of modern people are becoming 
more and more serious and frequent, which has greatly 
hindered social progress and reduced the happiness of Chinese 
residents (Trombello et al. 2022). In various surveys, more than 
half of modern people have varying degrees of psychological 
stress, and more than 26% of modern people suffer from 
various types of psychological diseases. Therefore, the 
psychological problems of modern people must be paid 
attention to (Adikari, Appukutty & Kuan 2020). As the main 
place for modern people to relax, the social intercourse of folk 
houses is also very important. Good residential design can 
relax the mood of residents, give residents comfort from visual 
and other sensory experience and use experience and alleviate 
residents’ negative emotions (Gelaye et  al. 2020). A poor 
residential design will, to a certain extent, aggravate the 
psychological anxiety and irritability of residents, not only 
failing to relieve their psychological pressure but also 
aggravating their psychological pressure. For example, the 
insufficient space design leads to the limited range of residents’ 
activities, the small computer table leads to only one computer, 
inconvenient dining, inconvenient clothes drying and other 
details (Menear et  al. 2020; Sharifian et  al. 2021). Therefore, 
based on the design psychology, the study analyses the 
psychological needs of residents for modern folk. Limited, 
modern 
people 
instinctively 
pursue 
freedom 
and 
unconstrained, so they have a certain demand for large space. 
During the design, it is necessary to remove some unnecessary 
objects and decorations so that residents can have a certain 
activity space. Then, the space design in the residential 
buildings should be as reasonable as possible, so that the 
residents can feel comfortable and relax their mood. For 
example, we should pay attention to the sense of privacy and 
security of residents. Finally, to meet the needs of residents for 
harmonious mitigation. Modern people have an inseparable 
connection with nature and instinctively want to get close to 
nature and embrace nature. Therefore, in the design of 
residential buildings, it is necessary to make the environment 
around the residential buildings and the residential buildings 
coexist and integrate harmoniously, so that the residents can 
approach the nature to the greatest extent, so that the residents’ 
mood can be relaxed and the psychological pressure can be 
released. Based on the above analysis, it is proposed to 
integrate the elements of Gannan Hakka architecture into the 
design of folk houses. Gannan Hakka architecture emphasises 
the 
integration 
of 
multiculturalism, 
the 
harmonious 
coexistence between humans and nature, the combination of 
spiritual belief and architecture and the people-oriented 
architectural concept. Integrating these elements into modern 
residential design can not only meet the psychological needs 
of residents but also provide them with a new sensory 
experience. After the experimental intervention, members 
of the characteristic residential group scored 72.30 ± 8.48 in 
the  emotional function dimension, while members of the 
traditional residential group scored 65.12 ± 9.03 in the 
emotional function dimension. The members of the 
characteristic residential group scored significantly lower in 
the role function dimension than the traditional residential 
group, with a significance of less than 0.05. The self-

management ability of traditional residential group emotions 
is 65.12 ± 9.03, while the self-management ability of 
characteristic residential group emotions is 72.30 ± 8.48. It is 
obvious that the emotional fluctuations of users in traditional 
residential groups are much greater than those in characteristic 
residential groups. Based on the above contents, the residents 
can relax their minds in the residential buildings, thus relieving 
their psychological pressure. In order to verify the effect of the 
design method proposed in the study, the results of the 
research and design experiments show that integrating the 
elements of Gannan Hakka architecture into the residential 
design can effectively relieve the psychological pressure of 
residents.
Conclusion
The integration of Gannan Hakka architectural elements 
into  modern residential areas is to better alleviate the 
psychological pressure of modern people. Starting from 
design psychology, this study integrates Gannan Hakka 
architectural elements into the residential design to meet the 
psychological needs of residents and alleviate their 
psychological pressure. The experimental results show that 
after the experiment, the scores of the members of the 
characteristic residential group in each dimension of the 
SEES and SF-36 scale are significantly higher than those of 
the members of the traditional residential group. In the SF-36 
scale, after the experimental intervention, the social and role 
functions of the characteristic residential group and the 
traditional residential group were 69.04 ± 8.02, 79.53 ± 7.46 
and 65.37 ± 9.18, 71.25 ± 9.52, respectively. After the 
experiment, the melancholic dimension score of the 
characteristic residential group was 1.35 ± 0.26, which was 
significantly lower than before the experiment, with 
differences within 0.05. The depression scale score of the 
participants in the traditional residence test was 1.91 ± 0.38, 
and there was no significant difference compared to the 
participants before the traditional residence test, with a 
difference of over 0.05. The scores of college students in 
characteristic residential areas on various dimensions of 
depression are significantly lower than those in traditionally 
residential areas, with differences within 0.05. After the 
experiment, the score of the specificity in the hostile 
dimension was 1.45 ± 0.45, which was significantly different 
from before the experiment, with a difference of within 0.05. 
To sum up, based on the design psychology, integrating the 
Hakka architectural elements of Gannan into the residential 
design can effectively relieve the psychological pressure of 
residents. In the future, the evaluation index system will be 
enriched and improved based on the development of the 
industry, while taking into account more factors that affect 
the comfort of residential areas.
